If you are trying to configure a function with parameters \u2013 like we require with <code>slugs.slugify</code> or <code>arithmatex</code>'s custom fences for SuperFences \u2013 then you must use <code>!!python/object/apply:</code>.

In an effort to make custom fences more useful, we wanted to be able to pass the <code>Markdown</code> object to the formatters. This gives custom formats access to things like metadata if required.</p> <p>The format of custom fence formatters already had two different versions: ones without custom options and one with custom options. As adding yet another parameter would cause more complexity behind the scenes, we decided to introduce the breaking change of creating a unified format for formatters with custom options and without. In addition to unifying the format, we also now pass the <code>Markdown</code> object to the formatters as an additional parameter.</p> <p>While we were breaking custom formats, it seemed like a good time to go ahead and change the defaults for the <code>custom_fences</code> options. Most people who are using SuperFences aren't even using the default, niche <code>flow</code> and <code>sequence</code> custom fences. Instead of hijacking fence names that most people aren't even using, it seemed more appropriate to define no custom fences.</p> <p>Below are instructions on how to upgrade if you were relying on the either the default settings of <code>custom_fences</code> or if you had written your own custom fence formatters.</p> <ol> <li> <p>If you've written your own custom fence formatters, the number of parameters needed has changed, so you must update     your existing formatters.

If you need to reject critic marks or accept them, the Critic extension will work quite well.  But when trying to render the edits visually and trying to convert the document to HTML, things can get ugly.  I think this is the one unfortunate problem with CriticMarkup.  The existence of the critic edits can alter the actual source.  Its a fantastic idea, but it should be understood that when using CriticMarkup beyond inline or block paragraphs, there is a possibility that invalid HTML will be created for the preview (especially in relation to lists or if breaking up Markdown syntax).  I think Fletcher of [MultiMarkdown][multi-markdown] said it best here:</p> <p>I view CriticMarkup as two things:</p> <ol> <li> <p>A syntax for documenting editing notes and changes, and for collaborating amongst coauthors.</p> </li> <li> <p>A means to display those notes/changes in the HTML output.</p> </li> </ol> <p>I believe that #1 is a really great idea, and well implemented. #2 is not so well implemented, largely due to the   \"orthogonal\" nature of CriticMarkup and the underlying Markdown syntax.</p> <p>CM is designed as a separate layer on top of Markdown/MultiMarkdown. This means that a Markdown span could, for   example, start in the middle of a CriticMarkup structure, but end outside of it. This means that an algorithm to   properly convert a CM/Markdown document to HTML would be quite complex, with a huge number of edge cases to consider.   I've tried a few (fairly creative, in my opinion) approaches, but they didn't work. Perhaps someone else will come up   with a better solution, or will be so interested that they put the work in to create the complex algorithm.

The hosted CDN provides 72x72 PNG emoji or SVG emoji.</p> <p>While Gemoji and EmojiOne have a short name convention, Twemoji does not, and there are very few 3<sup>rd</sup> party projects that provide short names anywhere close to all the provided emoji that Twemoji supports. Since JoyPixels has an MIT licensed index of short names closest to what Twemoji supports, we use their short name list for Twemoji. There will be a reasonable attempt to patch in emoji not found in JoyPixels' index, but if JoyPixels is ever significantly behind, we may wait for JoyPixels to catch up.</p> <p>Gemoji ( ): Gemoji is GitHub's open source emoji solution. It contains a lot of common emoji and a couple special, non Unicode emoji (like Gemoji's <code>:octocat:</code> ). If you are a GitHub user, you are probably familiar with some of the short names associated with it. Their associated CDN contains the emoji in 75x75 PNG format.</p> <p>Emoji Image Licensing</p> <p>PyMdown Extensions has no affiliation with EmojiOne, Gemoji, or Twemoji.

This will be <code>None</code> if the name used was not an alias. <code>uc</code> string This is a string representation of the Unicode, it could technically be anything as this is normally used to reference image files. So while some indexes will have this be code points, it may not contain code points at all or it may strip out code points for simpler image names. So the value here will not always be practical for calculating the actual Unicode points of an emoji.

It was originally written for a project that wanted to preview the markdown by rendering it in a temporary location. This extension allowed the paths to be converted to work from the temporary location. This context is important when trying to understand why this extension was created. It's actual usage is limited to situations like this, so it isn't something that would get used in most normal scenarios.</p> <p>PathConverter takes an absolute base path. The base path is the Markdown content's assumed location at time of conversion.  The path is used as a reference for locating images and referenced files relative to the Markdown content. Essentially, the references in the Markdown file would currently be relative to this base path at conversion time. The references existence is not verified, but the it is analyze to determine if it is a relative path, and if so, it is eligible for conversion. In the case of absolute mode, the relative Markdown references would be converted to absolute paths.</p> <p>If PathConverter is in relative mode, the extension will also need a relative path to convert to.  The relative path must be an absolute path to the location the HTML is assumed to live after conversion.  If the references paths can be confirmed to be relative, those references will be converted to relative paths that align to the provided relative path parameter. The idea is that a Markdown file could be found in a location that is not meant to be its final location. References within the Markdown source would link relative to the base path, but they would then be converted to be relative to it's new location \u2013 the relative path parameter.</p> <p>Currently PathConverter will search desired tags for <code>href</code> and <code>src</code> attributes. By default, only <code>a</code>, <code>script</code>, <code>img</code>, and <code>link</code> tags are searched.</p> <p>PathConverter is also intelligent enough to only operate on the file portion of the reference link.  Consider the following scenario:  <code>path/to/file.html#header-to-jump-to</code>.  In the example, <code>path/to/file.html</code> will be converted, but <code>#header-to-jump-to</code> will be left unaltered.</p> <p>As mentioned before, the use cases for something like this are limited, but if you have a situation that lends well to something like this, PathConverter can help.</p> <p>The PathConverter extension can be included in Python Markdown by using the following:</p> <pre><code>import markdown\nmd = markdown.Markdown(extensions=['pymdownx.pathconverter'])\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"extensions/pathconverter/#options","title":"Options","text":"Option Type Default Description <code>base_path</code> string <code>''</code> A string indicating an absolute base path to be used to find referenced files. <code>relative_path</code> string <code>''</code> A string indicating an absolute path that the references are to be relative to (not used when <code>absolute</code> is set <code>True</code>). <code>absolute</code> bool <code>False</code> Determines whether paths are converted to absolute or relative. <code>tags</code> string <code>'a script img link'</code> Tags (separated by spaces) that are searched to find <code>href</code> and <code>src</code> attributes. <code>file_scheme</code> bool <code>False</code> Produce file:// URLs instead of raw paths when converting paths to absolute."},{"location":"extensions/progressbar/","title":"ProgressBar","text":""},{"location":"extensions/progressbar/#progressbar","title":"ProgressBar","text":""},{"location":"extensions/progressbar/#overview","title":"Overview","text":"<p>ProgressBar is an extension that adds support for progress/status bars.

If JavaScript was disabled or unavailable, tab functionality would remain.</p> <p>@squidfunk (Martin Donath), the author and maintainer of the MkDocs Material theme, who originally collaborated on the first Tabbed style, approached us again with a newer style.</p> <p>The aim was to solve one big problem, namely that on narrower screen sizes (like mobile), tabs are broken onto separate lines, like here for example.</p> <p></p> <p>And this is indeed a real issue with the current style. The bonuses of the current style is that it needs absolutely no JavaScript and is driven by CSS alone. It supports as many tabs as you can throw at it but the downside is that when all the tabs do not fit on a single line, they'll wrap which is not aesthetically pleasing in all themes or interfaces.</p> <p>So, a new style was proposed, and we once again worked to hammer out the details, and in the end, we think we have something that is better in many ways. The new style works with only CSS and does not actually need any JavaScript to be functional, but it is ideally enhanced with a little JavaScript. The reason why is that when too many tabs are on a single line, you can overflow them with CSS and make the tab container scrollable. This can provide a much more aesthetically pleasing interface, but there are two caveats though:</p> <ol> <li>When tabs overflow, if you want a visual indicator that there are more tabs, it requires a little JavaScript.</li> <li>The number of tabs is limited by how many tabs you define in the CSS.</li> </ol> <p>As for the first point, this seems an acceptable restraint. When JavaScript is available, you will get a nice visual indicator, but if JavaScript is ever not available, or disabled, tab functionality will still work, just without the indicators.</p> <p>As for the second point, this also seems acceptable as most pages will usually have some upper limit of tabs that are ever used. Pages can become quite cluttered when using too many tabs, and it seems reasonable that most would limit them to some practical number.</p> <p>Alternate Tabbed Code Setup</p> <p>The example below styles the tabs, adds indicators that work as buttons to navigate to the next tab when the there are overflowed tabs, and scrolls tabs into view smoothly.</p> PreviewHTMLCSSJS <p></p> <pre><code>&lt;div class=\"tabbed-set tabbed-alternate\" data-tabs=\"1:3\"&gt;&lt;input checked=\"checked\" id=\"__tabbed_1_1\" name=\"__tabbed_1\" type=\"radio\" /&gt;&lt;input id=\"__tabbed_1_2\" name=\"__tabbed_1\" type=\"radio\" /&gt;&lt;input id=\"__tabbed_1_3\" name=\"__tabbed_1\" type=\"radio\" /&gt;&lt;div class=\"tabbed-labels\"&gt;&lt;label for=\"__tabbed_1_1\"&gt;Tab with a really long title 1&lt;/label&gt;&lt;label for=\"__tabbed_1_2\"&gt;Tab with a really long title 2&lt;/label&gt;&lt;label for=\"__tabbed_1_3\"&gt;Tab with a really long title 3&lt;/label&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div class=\"tabbed-content\"&gt;\n&lt;div class=\"tabbed-block\"&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Lorem ipsum ullamco ea aute do sint cupidatat elit nostrud exercitation dolore culpa aliquip nisi commodo nisi qui\nmagna non laborum proident id voluptate in cupidatat duis.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div class=\"tabbed-block\"&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Lorem ipsum ullamco ea aute do sint cupidatat elit nostrud exercitation dolore culpa aliquip nisi commodo nisi qui\nmagna non laborum proident id voluptate in cupidatat duis.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div class=\"tabbed-block\"&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Lorem ipsum ullamco ea aute do sint cupidatat elit nostrud exercitation dolore culpa aliquip nisi commodo nisi qui\nmagna non laborum proident id voluptate in cupidatat duis.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n</code></pre> <pre><code>/* General environment setup */\nhtml {\n  background-color: black;\n  height: 100%;\n}\nbody {\n  font-size: 120%;\n  width: 20em;\n  padding: 1em 2em;\n  margin: 0 auto;\n  background-color: white;\n  height: 100%;\n}\n\n/* Tab style starts here */\n.tabbed-alternate {\n  position: relative;\n  display: flex;\n  flex-wrap: wrap;\n  flex-direction: column;\n  margin: 1em 0;\n  border-radius: 0.1rem;\n}\n\n.tabbed-alternate &gt;

Simple paragraphs should not require an empty new line before them, but we cannot make a blanket statement about all blocks. If in doubt, use an empty line before the first content block.</p> <p>Some blocks may implement a special argument in the header for things such as, but not limited to, titles.

It may or may not be okay to     enable. Your mileage may vary.</p> </li> <li> <p>If the option is available in a diagram, we disable <code>useMaxWidth</code> as we prefer that our diagrams do not scale     within their parent element, we rather them overflow with a scrollbar. You can leave these enabled if you like.     Since we render our diagrams under a custom element with a shadow DOM, to get scrollbars, we simply enable     <code>overflow: auto</code> on the custom <code>diagram-div</code> element (under the host DOM, not the shadow DOM).</p> </li> <li> <p>We disable <code>startOnLoad</code> as we provide our own loader (for reasons we will get into later).</p> </li> <li> <p>We do a quite a bit of custom theme overrides. Most of this is done through the Mermaid configuration options:     <code>theme</code>, <code>themeVariables</code>, and <code>themeCSS</code>. Most users would simply use one of the default themes via the <code>theme</code>     option, so that is what we've shown above.</p> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"extras/mermaid/#custom-loader","title":"Custom Loader","text":"<p>While using Mermaid, we've found a couple of issues which we were able to solve by using our own custom loader. The loader contains all the logic needed to find the Mermaid diagrams, convert them, wrap them in a shadow DOM, and insert them into the current document.</p> <p>In order to use the loader, it should be attached to a <code>DOMContentLoaded</code> event to execute only after the document is loaded. We bind our logic to this event in our loader function that checks if the Mermaid library is loaded, and only if it is, we execute the payload.</p> <p>The issues we are working around withing Mermaid are found below:</p> <p>Issues</p> <ol> <li> <p>Diagrams that are found in tabbed interfaces or details, where the element may be hidden on page load, don't     always render at a visible size if using Mermaid's default loader.</p> </li> <li> <p>Mermaid uses IDs in their SVG diagrams, and these can sometimes cause conflicts if you happen to have IDs on your     page that match one that they use.</p> </li> <li> <p>Mermaid does not always use unique IDs. This can cause some elements of a diagram to disappear if one diagram     happens to have the same ID and it is hidden in a details element or a tabbed interface.</p> </li> </ol> <p>We solve these issues doing a couple things in our own custom loader.</p> <p>Solutions</p> <ol> <li> <p>Using the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> element as a parent, we attach a surrogate element to it and render the diagram there.     Once rendered, we then insert the diagram back to where the original custom fence was. This ensures it renders     under a visible parent, and renders at a normal size.</p> </li> <li> <p>We wrap each diagram in a shadow DOM element. This prevents ID leakage from one diagram to another or to the     host.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Apart from the issues we were trying to solve, we also use a custom loader for personal aesthetics as we like to render our diagrams in <code>&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;</code> tags.
