All extensions are found under pymdownx . Assuming we wanted to specify the use of the MagicLink extension, we would include it in Python Markdown like so: >>> import markdown >>> text = \"A link https://google.com\" >>> html = markdown . markdown ( text , extensions = [ 'pymdownx.magiclink' ]) '<p>A link <a href=\"https://google.com\">https://google.com</a></p>' Check out documentation on each extension to learn more about how to configure and use each one. Reminder Please read the Usage Notes for information on extension compatibility and general notes to be aware of when using these extensions. Extensions Arithmatex Arithmatex is an extension that preserves LaTeX math equations ( \\frac{\\sqrt x}{y^3} \\frac{\\sqrt x}{y^3} ) during the Markdown conversion process so that they can be used with MathJax . B64 B64 converts all local images in a document to base64 encoding and embeds them in the document. BetterEm BetterEm is a different approach to emphasis than Python Markdown's default. It works similar but handles certain corner cases differently. Caret Caret is an extension that is syntactically built around the ^ character. It adds support for inserting super scripts and adds an easy way to place text in an < ins > tag. Critic Critic adds handling and support of Critic Markup . Details Details creates collapsible elements with < details >< summary > tags. Click Me! Thanks! Emoji Emoji makes adding emoji via Markdown easy . EscapeAll EscapeAll allows the escaping of any character, some with additional effects. Check it out to learn more. Extra Extra is just like Python Markdown's Extra package except it uses PyMdown Extensions to substitute similar extensions. ExtraRawHTML ExtraRawHTML exposes Python Markdown's feature of parsing markdown in HTML blocks. No longer do you have to include all of Extra when all you want to do is parse Markdown in HTML blocks. Highlight Highlight allows you to configure the syntax highlighting of SuperFences and InlineHilite. Also passes standard Markdown indented code blocks through the syntax highlighter. InlineHilite InlineHilite highlights inline code: from module import function as func . Keys Keys makes inserting key inputs into documents as easy as pressing Ctrl \uff0b Alt \uff0b Del . MagicLink MagicLink linkafies URL and email links without having to wrap them in Markdown syntax. Also, allows shortens repository issue, pull request, and commit links. You can even use easily insert mentions: @twitter . Mark Mark allows you to mark words easily. PathConverter PathConverter converts paths to absolute or relative to a given base path. ProgressBar ProgressBar creates progress bars quick and easy. SmartSymbols SmartSymbols inserts commonly used Unicode characters via simple ASCII representations: =/= \u2192 \u2260. Snippets Snippets include other Markdown or HTML snippets into the current Markdown file being parsed. StripHTML StripHTML can strip out HTML comments and specific tag attributes. SuperFences SuperFences is like Python Markdown's fences, but better. Nest fences under lists, admonitions, and other syntaxes. Combine multiple fences together in tabbed groups, and even create special custom fences for content like UML.

FIX : Ensure ExtraRawHTML raises a deprecation warning. 7.0b2 Please see Release Notes for details on upgrading to 7.0. NEW : SuperFences, if using the attribute list format ( ``` {.lang .additional_class, linenums=\"1\"} ) allows adding additional classes. IDs can be added as well, though Pygments generated code blocks do not have a mechanism to actually insert IDs. The first provided class will always be treated as the language class. NEW : Custom SuperFences' formatters should now also include the keyword parameters classes and id_value to allow injecting classes and IDs via the now supported attribute list format. If a code block defines no additional IDs and classes, the old form will be used. Formatters should include **kwargs at the end to future proof them from future changes. NEW : Deprecate the SuperFences highight_code option. As SuperFences syntax has language classes built right in, disabling the highlight_code option makes little sense. While highlight_code is still accepted, it currently does nothing and will be removed at some future time. NEW : If a custom fence (SuperFences) or inline (InlineHilite) is given the name of * , it will override the default fence logic. NEW : SuperFences and InlineHilite no longer sync settings from CodeHilite. 7.0b1 Please see Release Notes for details on upgrading to 7.0. NEW : Add new Tabbed extension for general purpose tabbed content in Markdown. NEW : Deprecate old SuperFences tabbed content feature. This will be removed in 8.0. NEW : SuperFences' tabbed content classes have changed from supferfences-tabs and superfences-content to tabbed-set and tabbed-content respectively. Old style classes can be enabled with the legacy_tab_classes option in SuperFences. This new option will be retired with SuperFences tabbed content feature in 8.0. FIX : Numerous deprecation warnings associated with the recent release of Python Markdown 3.2. 6.3 NEW : pymdownx.extrarawhtml is now deprecated in favor of Python Markdown's md_in_html extension found in the 3.2 release. NEW : When using Pygments 2.4+, code under pre elements will also be wrapped in code blocks: < pre >< code ></ code ></ pre > . legacy_no_wrap_code option has been provided as a temporary way to get the old behavior during the transition period, the option will be removed in the future. NEW : Remove deprecated version and version_info . FIX : Allow single word hostnames in MagicLink auto-link. 6.2.1 FIX : Fix issue in PathConverter where Windows path conversion from relative to absolute doesn't always work in all browsers. 6.2 NEW : Upgrade Twemoji to use 12.1.3. NEW : Downgrade and lock EmojiOne version 2.2.7. 2.2.7 is the last truly free version of EmojiOne. This is the safest version that users should use. EmojiOne will not be updated anymore as they are now JoyPixels and have a license that is not that permissible. We've reverted support for any version greater than 2.2.7 to ensure we don't accidentally cause a user to improperly use JoyPixels' assets. NEW : Drop specialized to_awesome generator for EmojiOne. FIX : MagicLink: match the auto-link pattern in the current Markdown package. FIX : Fix fenced math escape issue when using MathJax script output format. 6.1 NEW : Upgrade Twemoji to 12.1.2 using the latest JoyPixels' (formally EmojiOne) short name index in JoyPixels/emoji-toolkit 5.0.4. NEW : Upgrade EmojiOne to 4.5.0 to the last release in the 4+ series. EmojiOne was rebranded as JoyPixels, but while the index is licensed under MIT, the image assets are no longer as permissible as they once were. The Emoji extension will only reference the last release under the older more permissible license (4.5.0). The option to use the CDN with EmojiOne 2.7 is still available as well which used an even more permissible license. NEW : Upgrade Gemoji to 3.0.1. NEW : version and version_info are now accessible via the more standard form __version__ and _version_info__ . The old format, while available, is now deprecated. FIX : Fix GitHub emoji CDN links to use their latest. FIX : Fix issue where entities in the form &#35; would trigger MagicLink's shorthand for issues. FIX : Don't install tests when installing package. FIX : Fix for BetterEm case **Strong*em,strong*** . FIX : Fixes for non-word character boundary cases in BetterEm, Caret, Mark, and Tilde extensions. 6.0 Please see Release Notes for details on upgrading to 6.0.0. NEW : Allow custom inline highlight code blocks. ( !380 ) NEW : SuperFences now has one custom format convention which now also accepts the markdown class object to allow access to meta. NEW : SuperFences no longer adds flow and sequence as default custom fences. Users will need to configure them themselves. NEW : Add new SuperFences formatters in Arithmatex that are compatible with SuperFences' custom fence feature and InlineHilite's custom inline feature. ( !380 ) NEW : Requires Python Markdown 3.0.1 and utilizes the new priority registry when adding extensions and uses the new inline processor API instead of the old methodology. NEW : Better aliases for Twemoji specific emoji. NEW : Upgrade support for EmojiOne to 4.0.0 and Twemoji to 11.2.0. FIX : Fixes to SuperFences behavior of \"preserve tabs\" vs \"normal\" operations. FIX : Fixes to PathConverter's output. ( #392 ) FIX : Remove unnecessary path code in B64. FIX : Fix issues with double escaping entities in code blocks after Python Markdown 3.0 update. 5.0 NEW : Add validator to custom fences so custom options can be used. ( !350 ) NEW : Add global linenums_special option to Highlight extension. Can be overridden per fence in SuperFences. ( !360 ) NEW : Add linenums_style option to set line number output to Pygments table or inline format. Also provide a custom pymdownx-inline format for more sane inline output in regards to copy and paste. See Highlight documentation for more info. ( !360 ) NEW : Remove deprecated Github and PlainHTML extension. Remove deprecated Arithmatex option insert_as_script and deprecated MagicLink option base_repo_url . FIX : Add workaround in Highlight extension for line number alignment issues in Pygments with certain step values. ( !360 ) 4.12 NEW : Add option to fail if specified snippet isn't found. ( #335 ) FIX : Windows issue with preserve_tabs option in SuperFences. ( #328 ) 4.11 NEW : Allow Arithmatex's \"smart dollar\" logic to be turned off via setting the option smart_dollar to False .

Coding Standards When writing code, the code should roughly conform to PEP8 and PEP257 suggestions. The PyMdown Extensions project utilizes the Flake8 linter (with some additional plugins) to ensure code conforms (give or take some of the rules). When in doubt follow the formatting hints of existing code when adding or modifying files. existing files. Listed below are the modules used: pycqa/flake8 pycqa/flake8-docstrings pycqa/pep8-naming ebeweber/flake8-mutable gforcada/flake8-builtins Flake8 can be run directly via the command line from the root of the project. flake8 Building and Editing Documents Documents are in Markdown (with with some additional syntax) and converted to HTML via Python Markdown and this extension bundle. If you would like to build and preview the documentation, you must have these packages installed: Python-Markdown/markdown : the Markdown parser. mkdocs/mkdocs : the document site generator. squidfunk/mkdocs-material : a material theme for MkDocs. timvink/mkdocs-git-revision-date-localized-plugin : inserts date a page was last updated. facelessuser/pymdown-extensions : this Python Markdown extension bundle. These can be installed via: pip install -r requirements/docs.txt In order to build and preview the documents, just run the command below from the root of the project and you should be able to view the documents at localhost:8000 in your browser. After that, you should be able to update the documents and have your browser preview update live. mkdocs serve Editing Document Theme It isn't expected that people will need to mess with the theme, but if it is needed, a little additional work is required. The documents use the Material theme for MkDocs with some additional local tweaks and additions. JavaScript additions are provided in docs/src/js and are in es2020 syntax and are converted to es5. Stylesheets are located at docs/src/scss and are written in SCSS, and are converted to CSS. All conversions are done in a Node.js environment. In order to get up and running, ensure you have a Node.js version >= 10. Then install the required modules with: npm install After that you can begin making changes. When ready, you can run the following commands to get a live preview while you make edits, lint your changes, or build the final output. Commands Description npm run serve Create a live preview at localhost:8000 that will pick up your changes as you make them. npm run build Build the final output which will package, minimize, and revision the scripts and stylesheets. It will also update the mkdocs.yml file to point to the new revisioned files. npm run lint Run just lint on the files. npm run clean_all This will clean out the generated CSS and JavaScript files. It will also cleanup the generated MkDocs' site. If you need to make changes to the mkdocs.yml file, do not update the one in project root directly, but update the one in docs/src . The build environment copies the one in docs/src to the project root and injects the revisioned script name(s) and stylesheet name(s). When serving via npm , if you want to make sure that the local version of pymdown-extensions is used, you need to configure npm run serve to call with Python instead of calling the MkDocs binary: npm run serve --mkdocs=\"python3 -m mkdocs\" . This is because if you are calling Python, it will look in the current working directory first for a given module when importing, but if you call the MkDocs binary, it will instead import the installed pymdown-extensions . Configuring the --mkdocs option is also useful if mkdocs is not in your path, or you want to call with a specific version of Python. Spell Checking Documents During validation, we build the docs and run a spell checker on them. The spell checker uses facelessuser/pyspelling and Aspell . As it can be trickier to run Aspell under Windows, it is not expected that everyone will install and run the spell checker locally. In order to perform the spell check, it is expected you are setup to build the documents, and that you have Aspell installed in the your system path. If you wish to run the spell checker locally, the recommended way is with Tox, which is covered in \"Running Validation With Tox\" . You can also run the spell checker by first installing the requirements (assuming a Linux system): pip install -r requirements/docs.txt sudo apt-get install aspell aspell-en Then build the docs: mkdocs build --clean And then run the spell checker: pyspelling It should print out the files with the misspelled words if any are found. If you find it prints words that are not misspelled, you can add them in the dictionary which is found in docs/src/dictionary . Validation Tests In order to preserve good code health, a test suite has been put together with pytest ( pytest-dev/pytest ). There are currently two kinds of tests: syntax and targeted. To run these tests, you can use the following command: If you wish to run the tests locally, the recommended way is with Tox, which is covered in \"Running Validation With Tox\" . You can also run the tests by first installing the requirements: pip install -r requirements/project.txt pip install -r requirements/extra.txt pip install -r requirements/test.txt And then run the tests with: python run_tests.py Syntax Syntax tests are essentially text files containing Markdown. They are found under tests/extensions . test_syntax.py scans all the files and converts the files to HTML with the extensions and options defined in tests/extensions/tests.yml . They are then compared to the current stored HTML output. If the two differ, the test fails. To run only these tests, from the root of the project run the following command: python run_tests.py --test-target syntax You could also run them directly with: py.test tests/test_syntax.py To run a specific syntax test: python run_tests.py --test-target syntax --file tests/extensions/arithmatex.txt To accept the differences in tests due to a change(s) you made, you can run the following command: python run_tests.py --update To update and accept the differences in a single test: python run_tests.py --update --file tests/extensions/arithmatex.txt Targeted Targeted tests are unit tests that target specific areas in the code and exercises them to ensure proper functionality. These tests are found in test_targeted.py . You can run only these tests from the root of the project with: python run_tests.py --test-target targeted You could also run them directly with: py.test tests/test_targeted.py Running Validation With Tox Tox ( tox-dev/tox ) is a great way to run the validation tests, spelling checks, and linting in virtual environments so as not to mess with your current working environment. Tox will use the specified Python version for the given environment and create a virtual environment and install all the needed requirements (minus Aspell). You could also setup your own virtual environments with the Virtualenv module without Tox, and manually do the same. First, you need to have Tox installed: pip install tox By running Tox, it will walk through all the environments and create them (assuming you have all the python versions on your machine) and run the related tests. See tox.ini to learn more. tox If you don't have all the Python versions needed to test all the environments, those entries will fail. You can ignore those. Spelling will also fail if you don't have the correct version of Aspell. To target a specific environment to test, you use the -e option to select the environment of interest. To select lint: tox -e lint To select Python 3.7 unit tests (or other versions \u2013 change accordingly): tox -e py37 To select spelling and document building: tox -e documents Code Coverage When running the validation tests through Tox, it is setup to track code coverage via the Coverage ( ned/coveragepy ) module. Coverage is run on each pyxx environment. If you've made changes to the code, you can clear the old coverage data: coverage erase Then run each unit test environment to and coverage will be calculated. All the data from each run is merged together. HTML is output for each file in .tox/pyXX-unittests/tmp . You can use these to see areas that are not covered/exercised yet with testing. You can checkout tox.ini to see how this is accomplished. Generating Emoji Indexes The Emoji extension has emoji indexes generated from the source of Gemoji, EmojiOne, and Twemoji. Below is the process for auto-generating these indexes. In the case of Twemoji, it will also reference EmojiOne's short name index, so you may need to do both EmojiOne and Twemoji if the support is not satisfactory. Ensure you have Requests ( requests/requests ) installed: pip install requests . Fork the repository and checkout to your machine. Navigate to the root of the project. Call the generator script: python tools/gen_emoji.py --gemoji , python tools/gen_emoji.py --emojione , or python tools/gen_emoji.py --twemoji . If you already have the latest tag locally, you can specify --no-download . It will prompt you to select a tag to download and/or use. Please pull the latest official tag. Please don't pull experimental tags. This should update the indexes. Then you want to update the tests. Force the tests to update via python run_tests.py --update . Make sure only the emoji tests get updated. Nothing is fool proof. If they make a breaking change to the files that the script parses, or the location of the files change, the auto-update tool may need to be updated itself (hopefully this would be a rare occurrence). If such a change does occur, and you are feeling brave, a pull request would be appreciated, but in time, they will be resolved regardless.","title":"Development"},{"location":"about/development/#development","text":"","title":"Development"},{"location":"about/development/#project-layout","text":"There are a number of files for build, test, and continuous integration in the root of the project, but in general, the project is broken up like so. \u251c\u2500\u2500 docs \u251c\u2500\u2500 pymdownx \u251c\u2500\u2500 requirements \u251c\u2500\u2500 tests \u2514\u2500\u2500 tools Directory Description docs This contains the source files for the documentation. pymdownx This contains the source code for all the extensions. requirements This contains files with lists of dependencies required dependencies for continuous integration. tests This contains the various tests that are run in order to ensure code health. tools This contains various tools that are necessary during development.","title":"Project Layout"},{"location":"about/development/#coding-standards","text":"When writing code, the code should roughly conform to PEP8 and PEP257 suggestions.

By default, SuperFences will now change the classes it uses for it's tabbed feature to match those of the new Tabbed extension. CSS should be updated accordingly. The classes that have changed are supferfences-tabs and superfences-content , which have changed to tabbed-set and tabbed-content respectively. Example CSS is updated in SuperFences for reference . To help with the transition though, you can quickly switch back to the old style classes by simply enabling the SuperFences' global option legacy_tab_classes : extension_configs = { \"pymdownx.superfences\" : { \"legacy_tab_classes\" : True } } To learn more about migrating to the Tabbed extension, checkout the Tabbed documentation . SuperFences' tab content feature will be removed in 8.0. There is no formal date for when this will occur, but it is recommended to begin migrating as soon as possible, but legacy_tab_classes can be used as a stop gap for the short term. Option Deprecation in SuperFences SuperFences has deprecated highlight_code . This option now does nothing and will be removed in some future release. If this option was used, you will have to use custom fences to implement this behavior with your own custom formatter. SuperFences' Attribute List Style Additional classes and IDs can now be injected into fenced code blocks with the format ```{.lang .more-class} . The attribute list feature also impacts the the custom formatter. While the default formatters will still inject classes and IDs to the top level element to preserve backwards compatibility, the formatter now must accept the new keyword parameters classes and id_value . If you have a custom formatter that does not adhere to this new requirement, you will see a user warning. The new format is: def custom_formatter ( source , language , css_class , options , md , classes = None , id_value = '' , ** kwargs ): return string While it is recommended for a user to update their custom formatters to receive the new parameters, at the very least, users should add **kwargs to future proof their formatters. CodeHilite Separation SuperFences and InlineHilite no longer sync settings from CodeHilite. To configure either of the extensions, Pymdown Extension's Highlight extension must be used. CodeHilite can be run along side Highlight if desired, but CodeHilite cannot be used to augment SuperFences or InlineHilite's behavior. Upgrading to 6.0 While there are a number of new features and bug fixes, the only backwards incompatible changes are with SuperFences' custom fences. In an effort to make custom fences more useful, we wanted to be able to pass the Markdown object to the formatters. This gives custom formats access to things like metadata if required. The format of custom fence formatters already had two different versions: ones without custom options and one with custom options. As adding yet another parameter would cause more complexity behind the scenes, we decided to introduce the breaking change of creating a unified format for formatters with custom options and without. In addition to unifying the format, we also now pass the Markdown object to the formatters as an additional parameter. While we were breaking custom formats, it seemed like a good time to go ahead and change the defaults for the custom_fences options. Most people who are using SuperFences aren't even using the default, niche flow and sequence custom fences. Instead of hijacking fence names that most people aren't even using, it seemed more appropriate to define no custom fences. Below are instructions on how to upgrade if you were relying on the either the default settings of custom_fences or if you had written your own custom fence formatters. If you've written your own custom fence formatters, the number of parameters needed has changed, so you must update your existing formatters. The needed parameters are the same regardless of whether you are using an options validator or not. def custom_formatter ( source , language , css_class , options , md ): return string flow and sequence are no longer defined by default. If you were relying on the default custom fences, you will have to define them manually now. The needed settings are found below: extension_configs = { \"pymdownx.superfences\" : { \"custom_fences\" : [ { 'name' : 'flow' , 'class' : 'uml-flowchart' , 'format' : pymdownx . superfences . fence_code_format }, { 'name' : 'sequence' , 'class' : 'uml-sequence-diagram' , 'format' : pymdownx . superfences . fence_code_format } ] } } If you are attempting to configure these options in a YAML based configuration (like in MkDocs ), please see the FAQ to see how to specify function references in YAML.","title":"Release Notes"},{"location":"about/release/#release-notes","text":"","title":"Release Notes"},{"location":"about/release/#upgrading-to-70","text":"","title":"Upgrading to 7.0"},{"location":"about/release/#tabbed-extension","text":"A new extension called Tabbed has been added.

If you prefer to use something other than MathJax, Arithmatex can output a more generic format suitable for other libraries like KaTeX . Arithmatex searches for the patterns $ ... $ and \\( ... \\) for inline math, and $$ ... $$ , \\[ ... \\] , and \\begin {} ... \\end {} for block math. By default, all formats are enabled, but each format can individually be disabled if desired. The Arithmatex extension can be included in Python Markdown by using the following: import markdown md = markdown . Markdown ( extensions = [ 'pymdownx.arithmatex' ]) Input Format By default, smart_dollar mode is enabled for the $ ... $ inline variant. With smart_dollar it is expected that the opening token ( $ ) is to be followed by a non-whitespace character, and the closing to be preceded by a non-white-space character. This is to help avoid false positives when using the dollar sign in traditional ways such as: I have $2.00 and Bob has $10.00. The previous statement requires no escaping of the $ character. But when needed, the $ character can be escaped using \\$ . smart_dollar can be disabled and will capture any $ ... $ whose dollar symbols are not escaped ( \\$ ). Inline Examples $ p ( x|y ) = \\frac {p ( y|x ) p ( x ) }{p ( y ) } $ , \\( p ( x|y ) = \\frac {p ( y|x ) p ( x ) }{p ( y ) } \\) . p(x|y) = \\frac{p(y|x)p(x)}{p(y)} p(x|y) = \\frac{p(y|x)p(x)}{p(y)} , p(x|y) = \\frac{p(y|x)p(x)}{p(y)} p(x|y) = \\frac{p(y|x)p(x)}{p(y)} . Tip When using MathJax, for best results, it is advised to not use generic mode, and configure MathJax without the text2jax extension since MathJax automatically detects Arithmatex's default output. If using generic mode (for libraries like KaTeX), Arithmatex will convert dollars to the form \\( ... \\) in the HTML output. This is because $ ... $ is extremely problematic to scan for, which is why MathJax and KaTeX disable $ ... $ by default in their plain text scanners, and why Arithmatex enables smart_dollar by default when scanning for $ ... $ . It is advised, if outputting in in generic mode, to not configure your JavaScript library to look for $ ... $ and instead look for \\( ... \\) , and let Arithmatex's handle $ ... $ . For block forms, the block must start with the appropriate opening for the block type: $$ , \\[ , and \\begin {} for the respective search pattern. The block must also end with the proper respective end: $$ , \\] , and \\end {} . A block also must contain no empty lines and should be both preceded and followed by an empty line. Block Examples $$ E ( \\mathbf {v}, \\mathbf {h} ) = - \\sum _{i,j}w_{ij}v_i h_j - \\sum _i b_i v_i - \\sum _j c_j h_j $$ \\[ 3 < 4 \\] \\begin { align } p(v _ i=1| \\mathbf { h } ) & = \\sigma\\left ( \\sum _ j w _{ ij } h _ j + b _ i \\right ) \\\\ p(h _ j=1| \\mathbf { v } ) & = \\sigma\\left ( \\sum _ i w _{ ij } v _ i + c _ j \\right ) \\end { align } E(\\mathbf{v}, \\mathbf{h}) = -\\sum_{i,j}w_{ij}v_i h_j - \\sum_i b_i v_i - \\sum_j c_j h_j E(\\mathbf{v}, \\mathbf{h}) = -\\sum_{i,j}w_{ij}v_i h_j - \\sum_i b_i v_i - \\sum_j c_j h_j 3 < 4 3 < 4 \\begin{align} p(v_i=1|\\mathbf{h}) & = \\sigma\\left(\\sum_j w_{ij}h_j + b_i\\right) \\\\ p(h_j=1|\\mathbf{v}) & = \\sigma\\left(\\sum_i w_{ij}v_i + c_j\\right) \\end{align} \\begin{align} p(v_i=1|\\mathbf{h}) & = \\sigma\\left(\\sum_j w_{ij}h_j + b_i\\right) \\\\ p(h_j=1|\\mathbf{v}) & = \\sigma\\left(\\sum_i w_{ij}v_i + c_j\\right) \\end{align} MathJax Output Format The math equations will be wrapped in a special MathJax script tag and embedded into the HTML. This format does not require the tex2jax.js extension when setting up MathJax. The tag will be in the form of < script type = \"math/tex\" ></ script > for inline and < script type = \"math/tex; mode=display\" ></ script > for block. By default, Arithmatex will also generate a preview span with the class MathJax_Preview that can/should be hidden when the math content is actually loaded. If you do not want to see generate the preview, simply set preview to False . Generic Output Format If generic is enabled, the extension will escape necessary symbols and normalize all output to be wrapped in the more reliable \\( ... \\) for inline math and \\[ ... \\] for display math (unless changed via tex_inline_wrap and tex_block_wrap in the options ). Lastly every everything is inserted into a span or div for inline and display math respectively. With the default settings, if in your Markdown you used $ ... $ for inline math, it would be converted to < span class = \"arithmatex\" > \\(...\\) </ span > in the HTML. Blocks would be normalized from $$ ... $$ to < div class = \"arithmatex\" > \\[...\\] </ div > . In the case of \\begin {} ... \\end {} , begins and ends will not be replaced, only wrapped: < div class = \"arithmatex\" > \\[\\begin{}...\\end{}\\] </ div > . Loading MathJax Arithmatex requires you to provide the MathJax library and provide and configure it to your liking. The recommended way of including MathJax is to use the CDN. Latest version at time of writing this is found below. MathJax 3 < script src = \"https://polyfill.io/v3/polyfill.min.js?features=es6\" ></ script > < script src = \"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mathjax@3/es5/tex-chtml.js\" ></ script > Legacy: MathJax 2 < script src = \"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/mathjax/2.7.0/MathJax.js\" ></ script > Generally, it is best to add your own configuration to get exactly what you want. Here we show some simple examples of configurations done in JavaScript. We've provided two basic configurations below: one that is configured for Arithmatex's MathJax Output Format , and one that works with the Generic Output Format by using tex2jax . These are a good starting point,so feel free to take them and configure them further. Please see the MathJax site for more info on using MathJax extensions/plugins and configuring those extensions/plugins. Default - MathJax 3 window . MathJax = { options : { ignoreHtmlClass : 'tex2jax_ignore' , processHtmlClass : 'tex2jax_process' , renderActions : { find : [ 10 , function ( doc ) { for ( const node of document . querySelectorAll ( 'script[type^=\"math/tex\"]' )) { const display = !! node . type . match ( /; *mode=display/ ); const math = new doc . options . MathItem ( node . textContent , doc . inputJax [ 0 ], display ); const text = document . createTextNode ( '' ); const sibling = node . previousElementSibling ; node . parentNode . replaceChild ( text , node ); math . start = { node : text , delim : '' , n : 0 }; math . end = { node : text , delim : '' , n : 0 }; doc . math . push ( math ); if ( sibling && sibling . matches ( '.MathJax_Preview' )) { sibling . parentNode . removeChild ( sibling ); } } }, '' ] } } }; Legacy: Default - MathJax 2 MathJax . Hub . Config ({ config : [ \"MMLorHTML.js\" ], jax : [ \"input/TeX\" , \"output/HTML-CSS\" , \"output/NativeMML\" ], extensions : [ \"MathMenu.js\" , \"MathZoom.js\" ] }); Generic - MathJax 3 window . MathJax = { tex : { inlineMath : [ [ \"\\\\(\" , \"\\\\)\" ] ], displayMath : [ [ \"\\\\[\" , \"\\\\]\" ] ], processEscapes : true , processEnvironments : true }, options : { ignoreHtmlClass : \".*|\" , processHtmlClass : \"arithmatex\" } }; Legacy: Generic - MathJax 2 MathJax . Hub . Config ({ config : [ \"MMLorHTML.js\" ], extensions : [ \"tex2jax.js\" ], jax : [ \"input/TeX\" , \"output/HTML-CSS\" , \"output/NativeMML\" ], tex2jax : { inlineMath : [ [ \"\\\\(\" , \"\\\\)\" ] ], displayMath : [ [ \"\\\\[\" , \"\\\\]\" ] ], processEscapes : true , processEnvironments : true , ignoreClass : \".*|\" , processClass : \"arithmatex\" }, }); Notice that in our generic configuration, we set up tex2jax to only load arithmatex classes by excluding all elements and adding an exception for the arithmatex class. We also don't bother adding $ ... $ and $$ ... $$ to the inlineMath and displayMath options as Arithmatex converts them respectively to \\( ... \\) and \\[ ... \\] in the HTML output (unless altered in Options ). But we do have to enable processEnvironments to properly process \\begin {} ... \\end {} blocks. Loading KaTeX In order to use KaTeX, the generic output format is required. You will need to include the KaTeX library: < script src = \"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/KaTeX/0.9.0/katex.min.js\" ></ script > And the KaTeX CSS: < link rel = \"stylesheet\" type = \"text/css\" href = \"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/KaTeX/0.9.0/katex.min.css\" > Though KaTeX does have its own auto load script, we want to ensure it only loads math content from elements with the arithmatex class. Below is a script that would do just that. Notice we check for and strip wrappers \\( ... \\) and \\[ ... \\] off the content of the elements and send it through the renderer. We also don't bother adding $ ... $ and $$ ... $$ to the inlineMath and displayMath options as Arithmatex converts them respectively to \\( ... \\) and \\[ ... \\] in the HTML output (unless altered in Options ). ( function () { 'use strict' ; var katexMath = ( function () { var maths = document . querySelectorAll ( '.arithmatex' ), tex ; for ( var i = 0 ; i < maths . length ; i ++ ) { tex = maths [ i ]. textContent || maths [ i ]. innerText ; if ( tex . startsWith ( '\\\\(' ) && tex . endsWith ( '\\\\)' )) { katex . render ( tex . slice ( 2 , - 2 ), maths [ i ], { 'displayMode' : false }); } else if ( tex . startsWith ( '\\\\[' ) && tex . endsWith ( '\\\\]' )) { katex . render ( tex . slice ( 2 , - 2 ), maths [ i ], { 'displayMode' : true }); } } }); ( function () { var onReady = function onReady ( fn ) { if ( document . addEventListener ) { document . addEventListener ( \"DOMContentLoaded\" , fn ); } else { document . attachEvent ( \"onreadystatechange\" , function () { if ( document . readyState === \"interactive\" ) { fn (); } }); } }; onReady ( function () { if ( typeof katex !== \"undefined\" ) { katexMath (); } }); })(); }()); Alternative Math Blocks Alternate Math Format The alternate math format functions use the default style that embeds math content in scripts, not the generic format that just escapes the content in plain text. InlineHilite and SuperFences both have a feature where you can specify your own custom inline and fence blocks respectively. Arithmatex provides a number of compatible formats that can be used in conjunction with InlineHilite and SuperFences to create an alternative (and possibly more preferable) syntax for math. In InlineHilite, by simply providing the following configuration (no need to include pymdownx.arithmatex as an extension), you can create a familiar inline math format: import pymdownx.arithmatex as arithmatex extensions = [ \"pymdownx.inlinehilite\" ] extension_config = { \"pymdownx.inlinehilite\" : { \"custom_inline\" : [ { \"name\" : \"math\" , \"class\" : \"arithmatex\" , arithmatex . inline_mathjax_format } ] } } Inline Math `#!math p(x|y) = \\frac{p(y|x)p(x)}{p(y)}` p(x|y) = \\frac{p(y|x)p(x)}{p(y)} In SuperFences, by providing the following configuration (no need to include pymdownx.arithmatex as an extension), you can create math fences: import pymdownx.arithmatex as arithmatex extensions = [ \"pymdownx.inlinehilite\" ] extension_config = { \"pymdownx.superfences\" : { \"custom_fences\" : [ { \"name\" : \"math\" , \"class\" : \"arithmatex\" , arithmatex . inline_mathjax_format } ] } } Math Fences ```math \\begin{align} p(v_i=1|\\mathbf{h}) & = \\sigma\\left(\\sum_j w_{ij}h_j + b_i\\right) \\\\ p(h_j=1|\\mathbf{v}) & = \\sigma\\left(\\sum_i w_{ij}v_i + c_j\\right) \\end{align} ``` \\begin{align} p(v_i=1|\\mathbf{h}) & = \\sigma\\left(\\sum_j w_{ij}h_j + b_i\\right) \\\\ p(h_j=1|\\mathbf{v}) & = \\sigma\\left(\\sum_i w_{ij}v_i + c_j\\right) \\end{align} Provided formats are found below: Name Description inline_mathjax_preview_format Inline format suitable for InlineHilite that preserves math in MathJax script format with an appropriate preview. inline_mathjax_format Inline format suitable for InlineHilite that preserves math in MathJax script format without a preview. inline_generic_format Inline format suitable for InlineHilite that preserves math in generic spans with arithmatex class.

Markdown ( extensions = [ 'pymdownx.critic' ]) Usage Critic Markup uses special markup to insert, delete, substitute, highlight, and comment. To insert or remove text you can use {++insert me++} and {--remove me--} respectively. You can also denote a substitution with {~~substitute this~>with this~~} . You can also highlight specific text with {==highlight me==} . Or even comment, which is generally done by highlighting text and following it with a comment: {==highlight me==}{>>Add a comment<<} .

General block handling. test remove test remove test remove test remove test remove test add test add test add test add test add Limitations with Previewing Critic Markup Parsing CriticMarkup is very straight forward. If you need to reject critic marks or accept them, the Critic extension will work quite well. But when trying to render the edits visually and trying to convert the document to HTML, things can get ugly. I think this is the one unfortunate problem with CriticMarkup. The existence of the critic edits can alter the actual source. Its a fantastic idea, but it should be understood that when using CriticMarkup beyond inline or block paragraphs, there is a possibility that invalid HTML will be created for the preview (especially in relation to lists or if breaking up Markdown syntax). I think Fletcher said it best here: http://fletcher.github.io/MultiMarkdown-4/criticmarkup . The Critic extension does its best by employing a preprocessor to inject the critic tags before all other parsing and a post-processor to clean up some of the weird side effects of the injection (only selected odd cases as others are more difficult to fix). It injects some classes into the edit region's HTML output which allows for CSS styling. There is probably a lot more post-processing that could be done to fix more issues, but whether this extension will be going further down that road has not yet been decided.

If you need to reject critic marks or accept them, the Critic extension will work quite well. But when trying to render the edits visually and trying to convert the document to HTML, things can get ugly. I think this is the one unfortunate problem with CriticMarkup. The existence of the critic edits can alter the actual source. Its a fantastic idea, but it should be understood that when using CriticMarkup beyond inline or block paragraphs, there is a possibility that invalid HTML will be created for the preview (especially in relation to lists or if breaking up Markdown syntax). I think Fletcher said it best here: http://fletcher.github.io/MultiMarkdown-4/criticmarkup . The Critic extension does its best by employing a preprocessor to inject the critic tags before all other parsing and a post-processor to clean up some of the weird side effects of the injection (only selected odd cases as others are more difficult to fix). It injects some classes into the edit region's HTML output which allows for CSS styling. There is probably a lot more post-processing that could be done to fix more issues, but whether this extension will be going further down that road has not yet been decided.","title":"Limitations with Previewing Critic Markup"},{"location":"extensions/critic/#css","text":"Critic renders the CriticMarkup with the following classes.

This is accomplished by using a short name index to map easy to remember names to associated Unicode data. The Unicode data is then converted into actual Unicode emoji characters and/or special HTML elements (usually images) that represent the emoji. Emoji Example :smile: :heart: :thumbsup: The Emoji extension can be included in Python Markdown by using the following: import markdown md = markdown . Markdown ( extensions = [ 'pymdownx.emoji' ]) Supported Emoji Providers There are a number of emoji short name conventions that people may be aware of. These conventions are always tied to a specific emoji set. These conventions differ because there is no official Unicode short name convention. At the present, Emoji chooses to focus on three specific emoji sets: Gemoji ( ): Gemoji is GitHub's open source emoji solution. It contains a lot of common emoji and a couple special, non Unicode emoji (like Gemoji's :octocat: ). If you are a GitHub user, you are probably familiar with some of the short names associated with it. Their associated CDN contains the emoji in 75x75 PNG format. EmojiOne ( ): EmojiOne is a high quality emoji set with support for gender and skin tone modifiers. Their free emoji set includes PNGs in sizes of 32x32, 64x64, and 128x128 which are all available via a CDN. The older EmojiOne (version 2.2.7), is what is used by default. It is the last truly free version. EmojiOne has rebranded with the name JoyPixels and now has an even more restrictive license for their graphical assets. Their latest short name list is still used for Twemoji as that portion is available under the MIT license via their toolkit repo JoyPixels/emoji-toolkit . Twemoji ( ): Twemoji is Twitter's open source emoji set which also covers a great many emoji with skin tones and gender modifiers. The hosted CDN provides 72x72 PNG emoji or SVG emoji. While Gemoji and EmojiOne have a short name convention, Twemoji does not, and there are very few 3 rd party projects that provide short names anywhere close to all the provided emoji that Twemoji supports. Since JoyPixels has an MIT licensed index of short names closest to what Twemoji supports, we use their short name list for Twemoji. There will be a reasonable attempt to patch in emoji not found in JoyPixels' index, but if JoyPixels is ever significantly behind, we may wait for JoyPixels to catch up. Emoji Image Licensing PyMdown Extensions has no affiliation with EmojiOne, Gemoji, or Twemoji. The indexes generated from their sources are covered under their respective licensing. When using their images or CSS, please see their licensing terms to ensure proper usage and attributions. EmojiOne 2.2.7: https://github.com/joypixels/emoji-toolkit#joypixels-version-2 http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/ Gemoji: https://github.com/github/gemoji/blob/master/LICENSE Twemoji: https://github.com/twitter/twemoji/blob/gh-pages/LICENSE-GRAPHICS All short name indexes that Emoji uses are generated from EmojiOne's or Gemoji's latest official source tag \u2013 Twemoji uses JoyPixels' index as the Twemoji repository does not ship with a short name index. The indexes contain the emoji names, short names, values, etc.; everything needed to insert Unicode emoji characters or specially crafted HTML elements. Emoji Output Formats Depending on your needs, you may have different requirements for how emoji get displayed in your documents. You may want to use PNG images, or maybe you really like SVG images. Maybe you just want to convert short names to the actual Unicode code points. There are a variety of ways you may want to output emoji, and the Emoji extension has you covered. Emoji provides various output formats that take the Unicode data associated with a short name (or the short name itself in the case of a custom emoji) and generates an HTML output. Not all of the provided output formats will work for each emoji index, but there are a few that should work for all three. Check out Default Emoji Generators or Custom Emoji Generators to learn more. Default Emoji Indexes By default, Emoji provides three indexes: emojione , gemoji , and twemoji . All indexes are generated from the most recent official release tag source (in the case of Twemoji, short names are acquired from the generated index in JoyPixels/emoji-toolkit ). They can be used by passing in one of the three functions below via the emoji_index parameter. Pass the actual function reference, not a string. If you need to create your own, just check out Custom Emoji Indexes . Tip If you are attempting to configure these options in a YAML based configuration (like in MkDocs ), please see the FAQ to see how to specify function references in YAML. pymdownx.emoji.emojione This is the default function that is used. EmojiOne was rebranded as JoyPixels and is no longer permissible enough to be used. The release used here is for 2.2.7 which is the last usable, truly free version of EmojiOne. Users are still required to comply with acknowledgments. JoyPixels 3.0+ graphical assets will not be supported moving forward as the license is too restrictive, tough the latest index of their friendly names is supported under the MIT license and is used to generate friendly, short names for Twemoji. You can always find out what tag it was built with by doing the following: >>> import pymdownx.emoji1_db as e1db >>> e1db . version 'v2.2.7' To see the full list of short names for this index, see the index source . pymdownx.emoji.twemoji This function provides an index of the latest Twemoji supported emoji (at the time of release). The associated short names are currently borrowed from JoyPixels' index found in their JoyPixels/emoji-toolkit repo. JoyPixels short name index is available under the MIT license and is used as Twemoji does not provide its own list of short names. There are a few emoji that are currently Twemoji specific, two of which are likely to always be as they are not part of the official emoji spec. The short names are listed below. Twemoji Specific Emoji Twemoji provides some non-standard emoji. We've made them available following the naming patterns that EmojiOne follows as we are using their short name index. The emoji are either some that only Twemoji supports, rarely supported by others, or emoji that have tone and/or gender modifiers that aren't supported in the Unicode specifications. We've also provided appropriate aliases for consistency with other like emoji. :pirate_flag: :shibuya: :skier_tone1: :skier_tone2: :skier_tone3: :skier_tone4: :skier_tone5: :woman_levitate: :woman_levitate_tone1: :woman_levitate_tone2: :woman_levitate_tone3: :woman_levitate_tone4: :woman_levitate_tone5: :woman_in_business_suit_levitating_tone1: :woman_in_business_suit_levitating_tone2: :woman_in_business_suit_levitating_tone3: :woman_in_business_suit_levitating_tone4: :woman_in_business_suit_levitating_tone5: :woman_in_tuxedo: :woman_in_tuxedo_tone1: :woman_in_tuxedo_tone2: :woman_in_tuxedo_tone3: :woman_in_tuxedo_tone4: :woman_in_tuxedo_tone5: :transgender_sign: :transgender_flag: You can always find out what tag it was built with by doing the following: >>> import pymdownx.twemoji_db as twdb >>> twdb . version 'v12.1.3' >>> twdb . index_version '5.0.5' To see the full list of short names for this index, see the index source . pymdownx.emoji.gemoji This function provides an index of the latest Gemoji supported emoji (at the time of release). You can always find out what tag it was built with by doing the following: >>> import pymdownx.gemoji_db as gmdb >>> gmdb . version 'v3.0.1' To see the full list of short names for this index, see the index source . Default Emoji Generators Emoji provides six default emoji generators. PNG output and Unicode code point output are supported for all three indexes. SVG output is only supported for Twemoji and the older 2.2.7 EmojiOne set. PNG sprites and the \"Font Awesome\" like format are only supported by EmojiOne. SVG sprites is only supported by the 2.2.7 EmojiOne. You can select a generator to use by passing in one of the functions below via the emoji_generator parameter. Pass the actual function reference, not a string. If you need to create your own, just check out Custom Emoji Generators . Tip If you are attempting to configure these options in a YAML based configuration (like in MkDocs ), please see the FAQ to see how to specify function references in YAML. pymdownx.emoji.to_png This is a general purpose generator which provides EmojiOne, GitHub, and Twemoji CDN path(s) out of the box. Depending on the index you've chosen, you the appropriate CDN will be provided. If this ever gets out of date, a new CDN can be passed in via image_path and/or non_standard_image_path . EmojiOne actually has multiple PNGs sizes of 32, 64, and 128, but the default CDN path is the one for size 64: https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/emojione/2.2.7/assets/png/64/ . You can change it for a larger or smaller PNG size by updating the size in the URL and passing the new URL in through image_path . The PNG output form is as follows: < img alt = \"\ud83d\ude04\" class = \"emojione\" src = \"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/emojione/2.2.7/assets/png/64/1f604.png\" title = \":smile:\" /> Generator Specific Options Option Type Default Description classes string Name of the index used Specifies the class(es) to be used in the image element. image_path string CDN for the default index used This can be either a local path or a CDN containing the assets. By default, an appropriate CDN is provided for EmojiOne, Gemoji, and Twemoji depending on which index is being used. non_standard_image_path string CDN for the default index used This can be either a local path, or a CDN containing the assets. Currently, only Gemoji's non-standard emoji take advantage of this as the GitHub CDN alters the path slightly for its non-Unicode emoji. By default, an appropriate CDN is provided for Gemoji. attributes dictionary {} A dictionary containing tag attributes as key value string pairs. The dictionary keys are the attribute names and dictionary values are the attribute values. pymdownx.emoji.to_svg This generator was written to output SVG images and supports EmojiOne and Twemoji. EmojiOne's SVG support is only for the free 2.2.7 release, so the default CDN still references the 2.2.7 release. EmojiOne short names added after 2.2.7 will not find images. You can of course reference local SVG images as well by pointing image_path to them as well. The SVG image outputs as: < img alt = \"\ud83d\ude04\" class = \"emojione\" src = \"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/emojione/assets/svg/1f604.svg\" title = \":smile:\" /> Generator Specific Options Option Type Default Description classes string Name of the index used Specifies the class(es) to be used in the image element. The default will match the name of the index used. image_path string A CDN for EmojiOne images This can be either a local path or a CDN containing the assets. By default, an appropriate CDN is provided for EmojiOne. attributes dictionary {} A dictionary containing tag attributes as key value string pairs. The dictionary keys are the attribute names and dictionary values are the attribute values. pymdownx.emoji.to_png_sprite This generator was written to support PNG sprite output for EmojiOne. It is expected that this will be used in conjunction with the the official EmojiOne CSS. You can include the CSS from the CDN in your document. The CSS comes in three sizes: 32, 64, 128. Make sure to set the correct size in the options to generate the appropriate classes. Example CDN for the 2.2.7 version with 64px PNGs: https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/emojione/2.2.7/assets/sprites/emojione.sprites.css . to_png_sprite outputs the emoji as a span in the form below. The CSS will apply the appropriate mapping in the sprite PNG to the background image of the span. < span class = \"emojione-64-people _1f604\" title = \":smile:\" > \ud83d\ude04 </ span > Generator Specific Options Option Type Default Description classes string Name of the index used Class(es) used for the span where the classes are inserted as \"class\" in the following template: ' %(class)s - %(size)s - %(category)s _ %(unicode)s ' . size int 64 Integer specifying the size for the class above. attributes dictionary {} A dictionary containing tag attributes as key value string pairs. The dictionary keys are the attribute names and dictionary values are the attribute values. pymdownx.emoji.to_svg_sprite This was written to support EmojiOne SVG sprite output. The output form was taken directly from an example in the EmojiOne source. It is expected that the the user will provide a local version of the official SVG sprite and the path to it. Unfortunately there is no free 3.0 SVG sprite, so you will need to download the old 2.27 one. The output is: < svg class = \"emojione\" >< description > \ud83d\ude04 </ description >< use xlink:href = \"./../assets/sprites/emojione.sprites.svg#emoji-1f604\" ></ use ></ svg > Generator Specific Options Option Type Default Description classes string Name of the index used Class(es) to apply to the svg element where the classes are inserted as \"class\" in the following template: ' %(class)s - %(unicode)s ' . image_path string '' Path to the SVG sprites. pymdownx.emoji.to_alt This generator supports all emoji indexes. The generator outputs the alt value directly to the document. The output can be Unicode characters, HTML entities, or even just the short name depending on what the global setting of alt is set to. \ud83d\ude03 There are no generator specific options. Custom Emoji Indexes In order to provide a custom index, the Emoji extension must be given a function that returns a suitable emoji index. No parameters are passed to the function. The function should simply return the custom index in the following format. emoji_index = { # Name is the name of the index. This is passed into the emoji # generator functions and can be used to differentiate logic # for different indexes if required. \"name\" : \"myindex\" , # The actual index. A dictionary of all the emoji. # Different emoji short names with the same Unicode data # can be mentioned under aliases. \"emoji\" : { # Key is the short name. \":zero:\" : { # Name is the long name. \"name\" : \"keycap digit zero\" , # Category of emoji. # Not needed if this is a non-Unicode, custom # emoji with no category \"category\" : \"symbol\" , # Unicode is the representation of the Unicode # code points, but it is not necessarily valid Unicode # code points. Essentially it is what represents the Unicode # and is used as the image name for pngs and svgs. Depending # on the index, it may not be code points alt all. It is also # sometimes used as part of special class names in the HTML # output (depending on the generator). # # In the case of Gemoji and EmojiOne this is the Unicode code # points with variations and joiners striped out. In the case of # Twemoji, it is usually full valid code points though leading # zeros are stripped from the beginning. # # Do not include this if the emoji is a custom, non-Unicode emoji. \"unicode\" : \"0030-20e3\" , # This is the full Unicode code points and is # used for the \"alt\" attributes in the HTML output of images. # It is redundant to include this if it is the # same as 'unicode', but it won't hurt anything if it is. # # Do not include this if the emoji is a custom, # non-Unicode emoji. This shows a fully qualified emoji code, # but it could just as easily be \"0030-2033\" which is also valid. # Some indexes will provide fully qualified, some may not. \"unicode_alt\" : \"0030-fe0f-20e3\" }, # No need to specify 'unicode_alt' as it is the same # as 'unicode'. \":thumbsup:\" : { \"name\" : \"thumbs up sign\" , \"unicode\" : \"1f44d\" , \"category\" : \"people\" }, # Should not specify any unicode fields # as this is not a real unicode emoji. \":octocat:\" : { \"name\" : \"octocat\" }, }, # Short names that share previously defined Unicode data # like '+1' and 'thumbsup' etc. \"aliases\" : { # Key is the alias. # Value is the short name it maps to in the # previously defined 'emoji' key. \":+1:\" : \":thumbsup:\" } } Custom Emoji Generators Each different kind of output is controlled by a different emoji generator function, but all generator functions have the same input format. The format is shown below in case you need to create your own custom output generator. def emoji_generator ( index , shortname , alias , uc , alt , title , category , options , md ) Parameter Type Description index string The name of the selected emoji index. shortname string The current short name. This may differ from the actual name used in a document as aliases get translated to the main short name. alias string If the specified short name is an alias, that alias will be set here, and the main short name will be found under shortname . This will be None if the name used was not an alias. uc string This is a string representation of the Unicode, it could technically be anything as this is normally used to reference image files. So while some indexes will have this be code points, it may not contain code points at all or it may strip out code points for simpler image names. So the value here will not always be practical for calculating the actual Unicode points of an emoji. This will be None for non-standard emoji that are not Unicode. alt string This is the alternative emoji value (or fallback value). Its format will differ depending on the extension setting alt and also the index being used. This will be returned as either the full valid Unicode characters or HTML entities, or it will be the short name used. See the alt setting for more info. title string This is the title that can be used in image elements. Depending on the global extension setting title , this will either return the full long description, the short name, or None . See the title setting for more info. category string Category of the emoji, or None if there is no category for the emoji. options dictionary This is a dictionary to specify generator function specific options. This can be anything, and it is up to the generator function to parse and provide defaults. md class This is the Markdown class object. This is mainly used to access specific things needed from the Markdown class when formatting your output. If you needed to stash your output, you would do something like: md . htmlStash . store ( alt , safe = True ) . Non-Unicode emoji Keep in mind that Gemoji ships with some non-standard emoji like :octocat: that do not have Unicode code points. uc and alt are affected by this and will return None and the short name respectively instead of strings describing the Unicode points. For example :octocat: will just return None for uc and :octocat: for alt . If you are parsing an index with custom emoji, like Gemoji has, then you need to be aware of this. Using with MkDocs This project uses these extensions with MkDocs to generate the documentation. It might not be obvious how to set the index or generator functions in MkDocs' YAML settings file, but it is actually pretty easy. The functions are referenced like you would import them in Python except you also append them with a special prefix to let the YAML module know that the setting value is a Python object. For instance, to specify the to_svg generator, you would simply reference it like this: !!python/name:pymdownx.emoji.to_svg (or you could use your own custom module ). markdown_extensions : - pymdownx.emoji : emoji_generator : !!python/name:pymdownx.emoji.to_svg Emoji Index Updates The Emoji extension might at times be behind on having indexes built from the latest repositories. We try to keep the indexes updated with new releases, but if they fall out of date, you can open an issue on the this project's issue page to alert the maintainer(s) and they will update them when someone gets a chance. Pull requests are also welcome. The process for updating the indexes is automated, so it is fairly easy to do a pull request. See Generating Emoji Indexes for more info. Options Option Type Default Description emoji_index function emojione index A function that returns the index to use when parsing :short_name: syntax. See Default Emoji Indexes to see the provided indexes. emoji_generator function to_png generator A function that takes the emoji info and constructs the desired emoji output. See Default Emoji Generators to see the provided generators. title string 'short' Specifies the title format that is fed into the emoji generator function. Can either be long which is the long description of the emoji, short which is the short name ( :short: ), or none which will simply pass None . alt string 'unicode' Specifies the format for the alt value that is passed to the emoji generator function. If alt is set to short , the short name will be passed to the generator. If alt is set to unicode the Unicode characters are passed to the generator. Lastly, if alt is set to html_entity , the Unicode characters are passed encoded as HTML entities. remove_variation_selector bool False Specifies whether variation selectors should be removed from Unicode alt. Currently, only fe0f is removed as it is the only one presently found in the current emoji sets. options dictionary {} Options that are specific to emoji generator functions. Supported parameters can vary from function to function. Legacy GitHubEmoji Emulation The Emoji extension was actually created to replace the now retired GitHubEmoji extension. Emoji was written to be much more flexible. If you have a desire to configure the output to be like the legacy GitHubEmoji extension, you can use the settings below. This shows the full setup. To learn more about the settings used, continue reading the documentation. import pymdownx.emoji extension_configs = { \"pymdownx.emoji\" : { \"emoji_index\" : pymdownx . emoji . gemoji , \"emoji_generator\" : pymdownx . emoji . to_png , \"alt\" : \"short\" , \"options\" : { \"attributes\" : { \"align\" : \"absmiddle\" , \"height\" : \"20px\" , \"width\" : \"20px\" }, \"image_path\" : \"https://assets-cdn.github.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/\" , \"non_standard_image_path\" : \"https://assets-cdn.github.com/images/icons/emoji/\" } } }","title":"Emoji"},{"location":"extensions/emoji/#emoji","text":"","title":"Emoji"},{"location":"extensions/emoji/#overview","text":"The Emoji extension adds support for inserting emoji via simple short names enclosed within colons: :short_name: .

These conventions are always tied to a specific emoji set. These conventions differ because there is no official Unicode short name convention. At the present, Emoji chooses to focus on three specific emoji sets: Gemoji ( ): Gemoji is GitHub's open source emoji solution. It contains a lot of common emoji and a couple special, non Unicode emoji (like Gemoji's :octocat: ). If you are a GitHub user, you are probably familiar with some of the short names associated with it. Their associated CDN contains the emoji in 75x75 PNG format. EmojiOne ( ): EmojiOne is a high quality emoji set with support for gender and skin tone modifiers. Their free emoji set includes PNGs in sizes of 32x32, 64x64, and 128x128 which are all available via a CDN. The older EmojiOne (version 2.2.7), is what is used by default. It is the last truly free version. EmojiOne has rebranded with the name JoyPixels and now has an even more restrictive license for their graphical assets. Their latest short name list is still used for Twemoji as that portion is available under the MIT license via their toolkit repo JoyPixels/emoji-toolkit . Twemoji ( ): Twemoji is Twitter's open source emoji set which also covers a great many emoji with skin tones and gender modifiers. The hosted CDN provides 72x72 PNG emoji or SVG emoji. While Gemoji and EmojiOne have a short name convention, Twemoji does not, and there are very few 3 rd party projects that provide short names anywhere close to all the provided emoji that Twemoji supports. Since JoyPixels has an MIT licensed index of short names closest to what Twemoji supports, we use their short name list for Twemoji. There will be a reasonable attempt to patch in emoji not found in JoyPixels' index, but if JoyPixels is ever significantly behind, we may wait for JoyPixels to catch up. Emoji Image Licensing PyMdown Extensions has no affiliation with EmojiOne, Gemoji, or Twemoji. The indexes generated from their sources are covered under their respective licensing.

You may want to use PNG images, or maybe you really like SVG images. Maybe you just want to convert short names to the actual Unicode code points. There are a variety of ways you may want to output emoji, and the Emoji extension has you covered. Emoji provides various output formats that take the Unicode data associated with a short name (or the short name itself in the case of a custom emoji) and generates an HTML output.

Its purpose is to provide a single place to configure syntax highlighting for code blocks. Both InlineHilite and SuperFences can use Highlight to configure their highlight settings, but highlight will also run all non-fence code blocks through the highlighter as well. The Highlight extension is inspired by CodeHilite , but differs in features. PyMdown Extensions chooses not to implement special language headers for standard Markdown code blocks like CodeHilite does; PyMdown Extensions takes the position that language headers are better suited in fenced code blocks. So standard Markdown code blocks will just be styled as plain text unless guess_language is enabled. If you wish to highlight lines and define line numbers per code block, it is advised to use the SuperFences extension. As previously mentioned, both InlineHilite's and SuperFences' highlighting can be controlled by Highlight. Both can use Pygments or JavaScript highlighters to do their code syntax highlighting, but all of the settings here only affect highlighting via Pygments except use_pygments and css_class . If you want to use a JavaScript syntax highlighter, set use_pygments to False or make sure you don't have Pygments installed. The Highlight extension can be included in Python Markdown by using the following: import markdown md = markdown . Markdown ( extensions = [ 'pymdownx.highlight' ]) Syntax Highlighting If Pygments is installed, it will be the default syntax highlighter, but if it is not, or if use_pygments is turned off, code tags will be rendered in the HTML5 format for JavaScript highlighting: < pre class = \"highlight\" >< code class = \"language-mylanguage\" ></ code ></ pre > Extended Pygments Lexer Options If using Pygments, some lexers have special options. For instance, the php lexer has the option startinline which, if enabled, will parse PHP syntax without requiring <? at the beginning. InlineHilite takes the approach of allowing you to create a special Pygments language with options. So if you wanted to enable startinline for php , you might create a language name called php-inline that maps to php with startinline enabled. This is done via the extend_pygments_lang option. extend_pygments_lang is an option that takes an array of dictionaries. Each dictionary contains three keys: name which is the new name you are adding, lang which is the language the new name maps to, and options which is a dictionary of the options you wish to apply. Highlight Example To create the above mentioned php-inline we would feed in the following to extend_pygments_lang : extended_pygments_lang = [ { \"name\" : \"php-inline\" , \"lang\" : \"php\" , \"options\" : { \"startinline\" : True }} ] Now we can do this: `#!php-inline $a = array(\"foo\" => 0, \"bar\" => 1);` To get this: $a = array ( \"foo\" => 0 , \"bar\" => 1 ); Line Number Styles Pygments has two available styles when outputting source code with line numbers enabled: table and inline . table is the default output and creates a table output for lines with numbers. inline places the line numbers directly in the source code output and can sometimes be undesirable as it copy and paste will always copy the line numbers as well. The Highlight extension provides a third line number style called pymdownx-inline . Instead of writing line numbers directly in the pre like Pygments' default inline style does, it writes the line numbers as < span class = \"lineno\" data-linenos = \"1 \" ></ span > . This way the line numbers are un-selectable and can be displayed with CSS: [ data-linenos ] : before { content : attr ( data - linenos ); } Line number styles are set with the option linenums_style as described in Options .

Borrowing from CodeHilite's existing syntax, InlineHilite utilizes the following syntax to insert inline highlighted code: `:::language mycode` or `#!language mycode` . In CodeHilite, #! means \"use line numbers\", but line numbers will never be used in inline code regardless of which form is used. Use of one form or the other is purely for personal preference. As this feature is discussed further, we will call these specifiers ( #! and ::: ) mock shebangs. Inline Highlighted Code Example Here is some code: `#!js function pad(v){return ('0'+v).split('').reverse().splice(0,2).reverse().join('')}`. The mock shebang will be treated like text here: ` #!js var test = 0; `. Here is some code: function pad ( v ){ return ( '0' + v ). split ( '' ). reverse (). splice ( 0 , 2 ). reverse (). join ( '' )} The mock shebang will be treated like text here: #!js var test = 0; . When using the colon mock shebang, 3 or more colons can be used. Mock shebangs must come immediately after the opening backtick(s) and must be followed by at least one space. If you need to escape a mock shebang at the start of a code block, just put a space before it and it will be treated as part of the code. The InlineHilite extension can be included in Python Markdown by using the following: import markdown md = markdown . Markdown ( extensions = [ 'pymdownx.inlinehilite' ]) Code Highlighting Assuming Pygments is installed, code highlighting will be handled by Pygments by default. If Pygments is not installed, or disabled, code blocks will be output for JavaScript syntax highlighters as < code class = \"highlight language-mylanguage\" ></ code > . Highlighting can be further controlled via the pymdownx.highlight extension. Using JavaScript Highlighters If using Pygments , the elements will be highlighted without issues, but you may need to adjust CSS to get the general style of the inline block the way you like it. If you are using a JavaScript highlighter, such as highlight.js , you will most likely need to construct a JavaScript method to target the inline blocks as these may not be targeted out of the box. You may also find it useful to tag inline code with a different class than what is used for block code so you can also process and style them differently. By default, it uses whatever pymdownx.highlight uses, but this can be configured independently for inline code in the options . Custom Inline Blocks Like SuperFences , InlineHilite now provides a support for custom inline blocks. Inline Math `#!math p(x|y) = \\frac{p(y|x)p(x)}{p(y)}` p(x|y) = \\frac{p(y|x)p(x)}{p(y)} Math Example For more indepth information on how to reproduce the example above, check out Arithmatex Documentation . Custom inline code blocks are created via the custom_inline option. custom_inline takes an array of dictionaries where each dictionary defines a custom inline code block. The dictionaries requires the following keys: Keys Description name The language name that is specified when using the fence in Markdown. If given * , it will override the base inline logic, the default for all inline names not handled by other custom inlines. class The class name assigned to the HTML element when converting from Markdown to HTML. format A function that formats the HTML output. The function should return either an ElementTree object or a string as HTML. New in 7.0b2 Starting in 7.0b2, you can override the base inline logic (the syntax highlighter) by specifying the custom inline with a name of * . This means that if an inline does not match any other custom inline, the default, fallback inline would be handled by your custom * inline. This can be useful for tailoring a inline for a specific, favorite JavaScript highlighter. Formatters In general, formatters take four parameters: the source found between the backticks, the specified language, the class name originally defined via the class option in the custom_inline entry, and the Markdown class object. Should return a either an ElementTree element or a string as HTML. When returning a string, InlineHilite will treat the string as ready for HTML, so escape what needs to be escaped as it is expected to be fully ready HTML and will be stashed and re-inserted at post processing. When returning an ElementTree object, remember to wrap string content as markdown.util.AtomicString to prevent it from being processed further, you can also stash raw HTML string content assigned to elements like InlineHilite does by default above. InlineHilite will not try and guess what you intend, you must manage your content in the ElementTree objects or the Markdown parser may apply other conversion to your HTML content. def custom_formatter ( source , language , css_class , md ): return el # Or string Options Option Type Default Description css_class string '' Class name is applied to the wrapper element of the code. If configured, this setting will override the css_class option of Highlight. If nothing is configured here or via or Highlight, the class highlight will be used. style_plain_text bool False When guess_lang is set to False , InlineHilite will avoid applying classes to code blocks that do not explicitly set a language. If it is desired to have plain text styled like code, enable this to inject classes so that they can all be styled the same. custom_inline [dictionary] [] Custom inline code blocks. window.MathJax = { tex: { tagSide: \"right\", tagIndent: \".8em\", multlineWidth: \"85%\", tags: \"ams\" }, options: { ignoreHtmlClass: 'tex2jax_ignore', processHtmlClass: 'tex2jax_process', renderActions: { find: [10, function (doc) { for (const node of document.querySelectorAll('script[type^=\"math/tex\"]')) { const display = !!node.type.match(/; *mode=display/); const math = new doc.options.MathItem(node.textContent, doc.inputJax[0], display); const text = document.createTextNode(''); const sibling = node.previousElementSibling; node.parentNode.replaceChild(text, node); math.start = {node: text, delim: '', n: 0}; math.end = {node: text, delim: '', n: 0}; doc.math.push(math); if (sibling && sibling.matches('.MathJax_Preview')) { sibling.parentNode.removeChild(sibling); } } }, ''] } } };","title":"InlineHilite"},{"location":"extensions/inlinehilite/#inlinehilite","text":"","title":"InlineHilite"},{"location":"extensions/inlinehilite/#overview","text":"InlineHilite is an inline code highlighter inspired by CodeHilite .

By default, it uses whatever pymdownx.highlight uses, but this can be configured independently for inline code in the options .","title":"Using JavaScript Highlighters"},{"location":"extensions/inlinehilite/#custom-inline-blocks","text":"Like SuperFences , InlineHilite now provides a support for custom inline blocks.

Custom inline code blocks are created via the custom_inline option. custom_inline takes an array of dictionaries where each dictionary defines a custom inline code block. The dictionaries requires the following keys: Keys Description name The language name that is specified when using the fence in Markdown. If given * , it will override the base inline logic, the default for all inline names not handled by other custom inlines. class The class name assigned to the HTML element when converting from Markdown to HTML. format A function that formats the HTML output. The function should return either an ElementTree object or a string as HTML. New in 7.0b2 Starting in 7.0b2, you can override the base inline logic (the syntax highlighter) by specifying the custom inline with a name of * . This means that if an inline does not match any other custom inline, the default, fallback inline would be handled by your custom * inline.

MagicLink can auto-link HTML, FTP, and email links. It can auto-convert repository links (GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket) and display them in a more concise, shorthand format. MagicLink can also be configured to directly auto-link the aforementioned shorthand format. If you happen to have some conflicts with syntax for a specific case, you can always revert to the old auto-link format as well: <https://www.link.com> . If enabled, repository link shortening will be applied to the the angle bracketed auto-link format as well. The MagicLink extension can be included in Python Markdown by using the following: import markdown md = markdown . Markdown ( extensions = [ 'pymdownx.magiclink' ]) Auto-Linking MagicLink supports auto-linking HTTP, FTP and email links. You can specify these links in raw text and they should get auto-linked. There are some limitations placed on MagicLink to keep it from aggressively auto-linking text that is not part of links. If you have a link that cannot be detected, you can always use the old style angle bracketed link format: <https://www.link.com> . Auto-Linking Example - Just paste links directly in the document like this: https://google.com. - Or even an email address: fake.email@email.com. Just paste links directly in the document like this: https://google.com . Or even an email address: fake.email@email.com . Shorthand Links MagicLink supports shorthand references for GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket issues ( #1 ), pull/merge requests ( !13 ), commits ( 7d1b190 ), and compares ( e2ed7e0...90b6fb8 ). You can also reference repositories ( facelessuser/pymdown-extensions ) and it supports mentioning users ( @facelessuser ). Mentions also works for social media (only Twitter is supported at this time). The syntax for repository providers is actually very similar to GitLab's syntax. GitLab was chosen as its syntax bridges the gaps between the three providers. GitLab and Bitbucket require a pull specific syntax while GitHub does not have one. I also preferred the subtle differences in GitLab's commit references as it was consistent with pull and issue syntax. Configuring To enable shorthand syntax for code repository providers and social media providers, enable repo_url_shorthand and social_url_shorthand respectively in the options . To use this feature you must first specify in the options your provider to which all shorthand references are relative to, but you will still be able to reference outside of your defaults. And if you are specifying a code repository provider as your default, you must also specify the user and repo (repository) which adds more context and allows you to shorten the syntax even more for issues relating to your default user and/or repo . This is useful if you are using MagicLink to write documentation for a project that is hosted on one of the supported code repository providers. If you are using this extension more generally, it may make more sense to set a social media provider as the default provider . There is no need to set a user or repo for a social media provider as the context is not useful for mentions. You will still be able to reference repository links with shorthand if it enabled, albeit in a longer format. Warning Links are not verified, so make sure you are specifying valid issues, repositories, and users as they will be auto-linked even if they are not valid. Mentions Mentions of other users are performed with the following syntax: @{user} . To reference a provider other than your default, use the format @{provider}:{user} Mention Example @facelessuser @twitter:twitter @facelessuser @twitter For code repository providers, you can also mention repositories. This feature is actually inspired by the GitHub only extension Python-Markdown/github-links , which performs similar auto-linking. The syntax to auto-link a repository with mentioning is very similar to auto-linking a user, except you append the repository to the user name like so: @{user}/{repo} . If specifying a non-default provider, the form would look like: @{provider}:{user}/{repo} . The output for repository mentions omits the @ symbol and will just show the user and repository, but you are free to style it with CSS to make it stand out more like has been done in this document. Repository Mention Example @facelessuser/pymdown-extensions @gitlab:pycqa/flake8 facelessuser/pymdown-extensions pycqa/flake8 Issues and Pull Requests Issues and pull requests are specified with #{num} and !{num} respectively. To specify an issue for a non-default repository under the default user, prefix the repository: {repo}#{num} . And to specify a repository under a non-default user, prefix both the user and repository: {user}/{repo}#{num} . And to reference an external provider, use the format {provider}:{user}/{repo}#{num} . If the default provider is a social media provider, then only the latter syntax can be used. Issue Example Issue #1 Issue backrefs#1 Issue Python-Markdown/markdown#1 Issue gitlab:pycqa/flake8#385 Pull request !13 Pull request backrefs!4 Pull request Python-Markdown/markdown!598 Pull request gitlab:pycqa/flake8!213 Issue #1 Issue backrefs#1 Issue Python-Markdown/markdown#1 Issue pycqa/flake8#385 Pull request !13 Pull request backrefs!4 Pull request Python-Markdown/markdown!598 Pull request pycqa/flake8!213 Note GitHub actually gives pull requests and issues unique values while GitLab and Bitbucket can have pulls with the same ID as an issue. So with GitHub, you can use #{num} format for both issues and pulls, and GitHub will redirect you to the appropriate issue or pull. GitLab and Bitbucket must specify pulls different from issues, hence the !13 format. Though GitHub doesn't need to use the pull format, you can if you like. This format was actually borrowed from GitLab. Commits Commit shorthand syntax is simply the 40 character commit hash value: {hash} . And much like issues and pull requests, you can denote a repository under the default user with {repo}@{hash} and a repository under a non-default user with {user}/{repo}@{hash} . Lastly, to reference an external provider, use the format {provider}:{user}/{repo}@{hash} . If the default provider is a social media provider, then only the latter syntax can be used. Commit Example 181c06d1f11fa29961b334e90606ed1f1ec7a7cc backrefs@cb4ecc5e7d8f7cdff0bb4482174f2ff0dcc35c61 Python-Markdown/markdown@de5c696f94e8dde242c29d4be50b7bbf3c17fedb gitlab:pycqa/flake8@8acf55e0f85233c51c291816d73d828cc62d30d1 181c06d backrefs@cb4ecc5 Python-Markdown/markdown@de5c696 pycqa/flake8@8acf55e0 Diff/Compare GitLab offers a useful shorthand to specify links to compare differences between two commits. This has been adopted for all the supported repository providers. Specifying a compare link is very similar to specifying a commit link except you must specify the older hash and the newer hash separated by ... : {hash1}...{hash2} . To specify a compare for a non-default repository under the default user, prefix the repository: {repo}@{hash1}...{hash2} . And to specify a compare under a non-default user, prefix both the user and repository: {user}/{repo}@{hash1}...{hash2} . Lastly, to reference an external provider, use the format {provider}:{user}/{repo}@{hash1}...{hash2} .

Unfortunately, mention link shortening is not presently supported due to the fact that MagicLink does not use any of the providers' API to verify user links, and some legitimate links can look like user links, but are not. If we specify long form URLs from external providers, they will be shortened appropriately. External Provider Example - https://gitlab.com/pycqa/flake8/issues/385 - https://bitbucket.org/mrabarnett/mrab-regex/issues/260/extremely-slow-matching-using-ignorecase pycqa/flake8#385 mrabarnett/mrab-regex#260 When specifying links that reference the configured provider , user , and repo , links will be shortened differently in light of that context.

Mentions also works for social media (only Twitter is supported at this time). The syntax for repository providers is actually very similar to GitLab's syntax. GitLab was chosen as its syntax bridges the gaps between the three providers. GitLab and Bitbucket require a pull specific syntax while GitHub does not have one.

To use this feature you must first specify in the options your provider to which all shorthand references are relative to, but you will still be able to reference outside of your defaults. And if you are specifying a code repository provider as your default, you must also specify the user and repo (repository) which adds more context and allows you to shorten the syntax even more for issues relating to your default user and/or repo . This is useful if you are using MagicLink to write documentation for a project that is hosted on one of the supported code repository providers. If you are using this extension more generally, it may make more sense to set a social media provider as the default provider . There is no need to set a user or repo for a social media provider as the context is not useful for mentions.

This feature is actually inspired by the GitHub only extension Python-Markdown/github-links , which performs similar auto-linking. The syntax to auto-link a repository with mentioning is very similar to auto-linking a user, except you append the repository to the user name like so: @{user}/{repo} . If specifying a non-default provider, the form would look like: @{provider}:{user}/{repo} . The output for repository mentions omits the @ symbol and will just show the user and repository, but you are free to style it with CSS to make it stand out more like has been done in this document.

Snippets is run as a preprocessor, so if a snippet is found in a fenced code block etc., it will still get processed. If the specified file cannot be found, the the markup will be removed. If you need to show a snippet example in fenced code, please escape it as listed in Snippets Notation . Snippets can handle recursive file inclusion. And if Snippets encounters the same file in the current stack, it will avoid re-processing it in order to avoid an infinite loop (or crash on hitting max recursion depth). Though it should be said, you should extreme recursion depth as you will hit Python's recursion limit.

If you need something more complex, you may consider using a template environment to process your files before feeding them through Python Markdown.

The Snippets extension can be included in Python Markdown by using the following: import markdown md = markdown . Markdown ( extensions = [ 'pymdownx.snippets' ]) Snippets Notation Snippets has two modes of inserting snippets: single line and block. Single line format is done by placing the following markup for the single line notation: --8<-- \"filename.md\" Or you can insert multiple files with block notation: --8<-- filename.md filename2.md --8<-- As you can see, the notation is ASCII scissors cutting a line followed by the file name. In the case of the single line variant, the file name follows directly after the scissors and is quoted. In the case of the block format, the file names follow on separate lines and an additional scissor is added afterwards to signal the end of the block. The dashes can be as few as 2 ( --8<-- ) or longer if desired ( ---8<--------- ); whatever your preference is. The important thing is that the notation must reside on a line(s) by itself, and the path must be quoted in the case of the single line notation. If the file name is indented, the content will be indented to that level as well. To reduce confusion in block format, it is advised to ensure the entire block is indented to the same level. If you need to escape the syntax, just make sure a minimum of a space is after the quoted file name for single line format, or a space after the start or end block markers in block format. --8<-- \"escaped notation\"<space> --8<--<space> escaped notation --8<--<space> If you have a file you want to temporarily ignore, you can comment it out by prepending the path with ; (notice the semicolon is followed by a space). This works for both single line and block format: --8<-- \"; skip.md\" --8<-- include.md ; skip.md --8<-- Formatting Snippets When inserting your snippet, it is important to remember that some snippets may need whitespace around them. This is the file that is including the snippet. We want blank lines before and after the insertion: --8<-- \"insert.md\" So we put blank lines around the insertion.

Create tabbed fenced code blocks . Ability to specify custom fences to provide features like flowcharts, sequence diagrams, or other custom blocks. Allow disabling of indented code blocks in favor of only using the fenced variant (off by default). Experimental feature that preserves tabs within a code block instead of converting them to spaces which is Python Markdown's default behavior. Reminder Remember to read the Usage Notes for information that may be relevant when using this extension! The SuperFences extension can be included in Python Markdown by using the following: import markdown md = markdown . Markdown ( extensions = [ 'pymdownx.superfences' ]) Nested Fence Format Start and end fence boundaries are specified with either 3 or more backticks or tildes. Start and end fence boundaries must both use matching symbols (backticks or tildes) and must be of the same number of symbols. If start is 3 backticks, the fence will end with 3 backticks. Start and end fence boundaries must be aligned to the same indentation level. Content between fences must be indented at least the same amount as the start and end boundaries. Empty lines are exempted. If you are using a fenced block inside a blockquote, at the very least, the first line of the fenced block needs to have the appropriate number of > characters signifying the quote depth. > ``` a fenced block ``` Too many blank lines will cause a blockquote to terminate, so remember to use > markers accordingly if not marking every line. > ``` a fenced block > with blank lines ``` If using a fenced block as the first line of a list, you will have to leave the first line blank, but remember that the list marker must be followed by a space. -<space> ``` a fenced block ``` Definition :<space> ``` a fenced block ``` Fenced blocks should be separated from other blocks by an empty line. Paragraph. ``` a fenced block ``` Another paragraph. Injecting Classes and IDs You can use the attribute list format to specify classes and IDs (IDs are only injectable in non-Pygments code blocks). The first provided class is always used as the language class. Arbitrary attributes in the form key=\"value\" cannot be inserted as those are reserved for options such has linenums etc. Injecting Classes Source ```{.python .extra-class linenums=\"1\"} import hello_world ``` HTML < table class = \"extra-class highlighttable\" >< tr >< td class = \"linenos\" >< div class = \"linenodiv\" >< pre >< span ></ span > 1 </ pre ></ div ></ td >< td class = \"code\" >< div class = \"extra-class highlight\" >< pre >< span ></ span >< code >< span cv ></ td >< td class = \"code\" >< div class = \"extra-class highlight\" >< pre >< span ></ span >< code >< span class = \"kn\" > import </ span > < spanlass =\" kn \" > import </ span > < span class = \"nn\" > hello_world </ span > \\n </ code ></ pre ></ div > \\n </ td ></ tr ></ table > When generating additional classes on a JavaScript style code block (non-Pygments code blocks), classes are injected in the code block. Non-Pygments Injecting Classes === \"Source\" ```{.python .extra-class #id linenums=\"1\"} import hello_world ``` HTML < pre id = \"id\" class = \"highlight\" >< code class = \"extra-class language-python linenums\" > import hello_world </ code ></ pre > When using a built in custom formatter , all classes and IDs are injected on to the first element < div > or < pre > . This preserves previous behavior, but you can write your own and inject them in the way that suites your needs. Tabbed Fences Deprecated 7.0b1 The tab option is deprecated in 7.0b1 due to the addition of the general purpose tab extension pymdownx.tabbed . The feature is still usable, but by the class names on the output have changed from superfences-tabs and superfences-content to tabbed-set and tabbed-content respectively. This is to help create unity between the new extension and this feature as we guide people towards the new extension. To use the legacy class names, you can use the global legacy_tab_classes option to get the old style classes. This option will be removed, along with the entire tab=\"\" feature in 8.0. SuperFences has the ability to create tabbed code blocks. Simply add tab=\"tab-title\" to the fence's header, and the code block will will be rendered in a tab with the title tab-title . If you do not provide a title with either tab= or tab=\"\" , but you've specified a language, the language will be used as the title. No case transformation is applied \u2013 what you type is what you get. Consecutive code tabs will be grouped together. Tabbed Code ```Bash tab= #!/bin/bash STR=\"Hello World!\" echo $STR ``` ```C tab= #include int main(void) { printf(\"hello, world\\n\"); } ``` ```C++ tab= #include <iostream> int main() { std::cout << \"Hello, world!\\n\"; return 0; } ``` ```C# tab= using System; class Program { static void Main(string[] args) { Console.WriteLine(\"Hello, world!\"); } } ``` Bash #!/bin/bash STR = \"Hello World!\" echo $STR C #include int main(void) { printf ( \"hello, world \\n \" ); } C++ #include <iostream> int main () { std :: cout << \"Hello, world! \\n \" ; return 0 ; } C# using System ; class Program { static void Main ( string [] args ) { Console . WriteLine ( \"Hello, world!\" ); } } In order to use tabbed code blocks, some additional CSS is needed. You can check out the configuration below which will show the CSS and the HTML it targets. Keep in mind the CSS is just the minimum to get you started. You can tweak it and modify it to get it how you like it. Tabbed Code Setup HTML < div class = \"tabbed-set\" > < input name = \"__tabbed_1\" type = \"radio\" id = \"__tabbed_1_1\" checked = \"checked\" > < label for = \"__tabbed_1_1\" > Tab 0 </ label > < div class = \"tabbed-content\" > ... </ div > ... < input name = \"__tabbed_1\" type = \"radio\" id = \"__tabbed_1_X\" checked = \"checked\" > < label for = \"__tabbed_1_X\" > Tab X </ label > < div class = \"tabbed-content\" > ... </ div > ... </ div > CSS . tabbed-set { display : flex ; position : relative ; flex-wrap : wrap ; } . tabbed-set . highlight { background : #ddd ; } . tabbed-set . tabbed-content { display : none ; order : 99 ; width : 100 % ; } . tabbed-set label { width : auto ; margin : 0 0.5 em ; padding : 0.25 em ; font-size : 120 % ; cursor : pointer ; } . tabbed-set input { position : absolute ; opacity : 0 ; } . tabbed-set input : nth-child ( n + 1 ) { color : #333333 ; } . tabbed-set input : nth-child ( n + 1 ) : checked + label { color : #FF5252 ; } . tabbed-set input : nth-child ( n + 1 ) : checked + label + . tabbed-content { display : block ; } Preserve tabs Python Markdown has an approach where it normalizes whitespace. This means \\r\\n is converted to \\n and \\t is converted to spaces. In 99% of Markdown, this is never really an issue, but with code blocks it can be. Tabs can sometimes be very useful for aligning certain kinds of data, especially when dealing with characters of varying width. Tabs in Content ============================================================ T Tp Sp D Dp S D7 T ------------------------------------------------------------ A F#m Bm E C#m D E7 A A# Gm Cm F Dm D# F7 A# B\u266d Gm Cm F Dm E\u266dm F7 B\u266d If you have a scenario where preserving tabs is a requirement, you can use SuperFences preserve_tabs option to prevent converting tabs to spaces inside fenced code blocks. This only applies to fenced code blocks. Indented code blocks and inline code blocks will still be treated with Python Markdown's default behavior. This feature is experimental and actually applies the fences before whitespace normalization and bypasses the normalization for the code content. Code Highlighting Assuming Pygments is installed, code highlighting will be handled by Pygments by default. If Pygments is not installed, or disabled, code blocks will be created using HTML5 style tags for a JavaScript syntax highlighter: < pre class = \"highlight\" >< code class = \"language-mylanguage\" ></ code ></ pre > . If you disable highlight_code , specified languages will be ignored, and the content will be wrapped in a simple pre and code tags with no classes. Highlighting can be further controlled via the pymdownx.highlight extension. When using fenced code blocks, you can specify a specific syntax language to highlight with by specifying the language name directly after the opening tokens (either ``` or ~~~ ). Whether using Pygments or some other JavaScript highlighter, the syntax is the same, but please consult your highlighter's documentation for recognized language syntax specifiers. Highlight Example Source ```py3 import foo.bar ``` Output import foo.bar Showing Line Numbers Line numbers are provided via Pygments and can either be shown per code block or globally for all. To show globally via pymdownx.highlight , you must set linenums to True in the respective extension. To set line numbers per code block, you can specify a special setting directly after the opening tokens (and language if present). Simply specify the starting line line number with option linenums=\"1\" . The setting is followed by the equal sign and the value must be quoted. Valid line numbers are n > 0. If linenums is enabled globally, this will just control the starting line shown in the block. Line Number Example Source ``` linenums=\"1\" import foo.bar ``` Output import foo.bar Pygments also has a few additional options in regards to line numbers. One is \"line step\" which, if set to a number n > 1, will print only every n th line number. The other option is a setting that can mark line numbers as \"special\" with a span and class special . If the special parameter is set to a number n > 0, every n th line number is given the CSS class special . So to set showing only every other line number, we could do the following. Line options are separated by a space, and \"line step\" is always the second option, so you must specify line start before line step. Nth Line Example Source ``` linenums=\"2 2\" \"\"\"Some file.\"\"\" import foo.bar import boo.baz import foo.bar.baz ``` Output \"\"\"Some file.\"\"\" import foo.bar import boo.baz import foo.bar.baz To set every other line as special, you must set the third linenums option (specify line start and step before it). Special must be a value of n > 0. Special Line Example Source ``` linenums=\"1 1 2\" \"\"\"Some file.\"\"\" import foo.bar import boo.baz import foo.bar.baz ``` Output \"\"\"Some file.\"\"\" import foo.bar import boo.baz import foo.bar.baz For JavaScript libraries, a class of linenums is written to the block. This may or may not be leveraged by your chosen highlighter. It is uncertain at this time whether line number support for JavaScript highlighters will be enhanced beyond this.w what to inject. Highlighting Lines Via Pygments, certain lines can be specified for highlighting. This is done by specifying a special setting directly after the opening tokens (and language if present). The setting is named hl_lines and the value should be the targeted line numbers separated by spaces. Highlight Lines Example Source ``` hl_lines=\"1 3\" \"\"\"Some file.\"\"\" import foo.bar import boo.baz import foo.bar.baz ``` Output \"\"\"Some file.\"\"\" import foo.bar import boo.baz import foo.bar.baz Line numbers are always referenced starting at 1 ignoring what the line number is labeled as when showing line numbers. Highlight Lines with Line Numbers Example Source ```hl_lines=\"1 3\" linenums=\"2\" \"\"\"Some file.\"\"\" import foo.bar import boo.baz import foo.bar.baz ``` Output \"\"\"Some file.\"\"\" import foo.bar import boo.baz import foo.bar.baz Custom Fences SuperFences allows defining custom fences for special purposes, like flow charts and sequence diagrams: Flow Chart Example Source ```flow st=>start: Start:>http://www.google.com[blank] e=>end:>http://www.google.com op1=>operation: My Operation sub1=>subroutine: My Subroutine cond=>condition: Yes or No?:>http://www.google.com io=>inputoutput: catch something... st->op1->cond cond(yes)->io->e cond(no)->sub1(right)->op1 ``` Output st=>start: Start:>http://www.google.com[blank] e=>end:>http://www.google.com op1=>operation: My Operation sub1=>subroutine: My Subroutine cond=>condition: Yes or No?:>http://www.google.com io=>inputoutput: catch something... st->op1->cond cond(yes)->io->e cond(no)->sub1(right)->op1 Sequence Diagram Example Source ```sequence Title: Here is a title A->B: Normal line B-->C: Dashed line C->>D: Open arrow D-->>A: Dashed open arrow ``` Output Title: Here is a title A->B: Normal line B-->C: Dashed line C->>D: Open arrow D-->>A: Dashed open arrow As shown above, SuperFences defines two default custom fences (which can be removed if desired) called flow and sequence , for flowcharts and sequence diagrams respectively. The default custom fences simply preserve the content between the fences so a JavaScript UML library can convert the content and render the UML. To see exactly how to set up UML like in this documentation, see UML Diagram Example . Custom fences are created via the custom_fences option. custom_fences takes an array of dictionaries where each dictionary defines a custom fence. The dictionaries requires the following keys: Keys Description name The language name that is specified when using the fence in Markdown. If given * , it will override the base fence logic, the default for all fence names not handled by other custom fences. class The class name assigned to the HTML element when converting from Markdown to HTML. format A function that formats the HTML output. The function should return a string as HTML. validator An optional parameter that is used to provide a function to validate custom fence parameters. New in 7.0b2 Starting in 7.0b2, you can override the base fence logic (the syntax highlighter) by specifying the custom fence with a name of * . This means that if a fence does not match any other custom fences, the default, fallback fence would be handled by your custom * fence. This can be useful for tailoring a fence output with custom parameters for a specific, favorite JavaScript highlighter. Formatters SuperFences provides two format functions by default, but you can always write your own: Format Function Description superfences.fence_code_format Places the HTML escaped content of the fence under a < pre >< code > block. superfences.fence_div_format Places the HTML escaped content of the fence under a < div > block. In general, formatters take five parameters: the source found between the fences, the specified language, the class name originally defined via the class option in the custom_fence entry, custom options, and the Markdown object (in case you want access to meta data etc.). def custom_formatter ( source , language , css_class , options , md , classes = None , id_value = '' , ** kwargs ): return string New 7.0b2 The addition of the parameters classes and id_value is new in 7.0b2. If injecting additional classes or ids via the attribute list style , only then will classes and id_value be passed in to preserve backwards compatibility with old custom formatters. Users, moving forward, should at the very least update their formatters with **kwargs to future proof their custom formatters in case additional parameters are added in the future. All formatters should return a string as HTML. Tip If you are attempting to configure these options in a YAML based configuration (like in MkDocs ), please see the FAQ to see how to specify function references in YAML. Validators The validator is used to provide functions that accept or reject provided fence options. The validator is sent two parameters: the language defined in the fence, and a dictionary of options to validate. Custom options can be used as keys with quoted values ( key=\"value\" ), or as keys with no value which are used more as a boolean ( key= ). SuperFences will parse the options in the fence and then pass them to the validator. If the validator returns true, the options will be accepted and later passed to the formatter. This custom fence: ```custom_fence custom_option=\"value\" other_custom_option= content ``` Would yield this option dictionary: { \"custom_option\" : \"value\" , \"other_custom_option\" : True } For a contrived example: if we wanted to define a custom fence named test that accepts an option opt that can only be assigned a value of A , we would write the following validator: def custom_validator ( language , options ): \"\"\"Custom validator.\"\"\" okay = True for k in options . keys (): if k != 'opt' : okay = False break if okay : if options [ 'opt' ] != \"A\" : okay = False return okay Then later the formatter would be given the options: def custom_format ( source , language , class_name , options , md ): \"\"\"Custom format.\"\"\" return '<div class_name=\" %s %s \", data-option=\" %s \"> %s </div>' % ( language , class_name , options [ 'opt' ], html_escape ( source )) This would allow us to use the following custom fence: ```test opt=\"A\" test ``` Tip If you are attempting to configure these options in a YAML based configuration (like in MkDocs ), please see the FAQ to see how to specify function references in YAML. UML Diagram Example This example illustrates how this document uses the custom_fences option to do UML diagrams. The settings below shows two new custom languages called flow and sequence and are the options that must be fed through the custom_fences option . The flow and sequence fences will pass the content through the superfences.fence_code_format format function which will wrap the content in < pre >< code blocks and attach the class uml-flowchart or uml-sequence-diagram to the respective < pre > block. superfences.fence_div_format could just as easily be used to wrap the content in a < div > instead, or a new custom function could have been written and used. extension_configs = { \"pymdownx.superfences\" : { \"custom_fences\" : [ { 'name' : 'flow' , 'class' : 'uml-flowchart' , 'format' : pymdownx . superfences . fence_code_format }, { 'name' : 'sequence' , 'class' : 'uml-sequence-diagram' , 'format' : pymdownx . superfences . fence_code_format } ] } } As defined above, the custom UML diagrams are recognized when defining a fenced code block with either the language flow or sequence . When they are converted, the HTML element containing this content will have the respective classes uml-flowchart or uml-sequence-diagram . The format function we used in this example only escapes the content to be included in HTML. We will rely on JavaScript libraries to render our flowcharts/diagrams in the browser. The JavaScript libraries used to render UML in this document are flowchart.js and sequence-diagram.js . This extension does not provide these JavaScript libraries; you must provide the necessary JavaScript files for your custom fences yourself. If you wish to follow along with this example to enable UML, see the requirements below. flowcharts raphael.js flowchart.js sequence diagrams Minimum requirements for the latest version available via CDN (at the time of writing this). raphael.js underscore.js sequence-diagram.js All of the above mentioned libraries can be included using CDNs (you can use the version of your choice): < script src = \"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/raphael/2.2.7/raphael.min.js\" ></ script > < script src = \"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/underscore.js/1.8.3/underscore-min.js\" ></ script > < script src = \"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/js-sequence-diagrams/1.0.6/sequence-diagram-min.js\" ></ script > < script src = \"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/flowchart/1.6.5/flowchart.min.js\" ></ script > Simply including the libraries above is not enough as these libraries need to be pointed at the elements they need to convert. Also, we need to configure the libraries with the settings we would like. As mentioned earlier, our flowchart elements have the uml-flowchart class assigned to them, and the sequence diagram elements have the uml-sequence-diagram class assigned to them. Below shows an example script to convert the UML diagrams for both flowcharts and sequence diagrams using the listed libraries above. This script will target the elements with the classes uml-flowchart and uml-sequence-diagram . The script will pass the content to the correct library to render the content. It will then insert the rendered UML and remove the original source. This is just an example, and you are not required to use the following script. You are free to modify the example script or write your own to suite your specific custom fence. In the below example we create an onReady function to execute the conversion when the HTML is loaded. We create a convertUML function that takes the class name to search for, the converter to use, and a settings object to feed into the converter. We then call onReady and feed it a callback function that will execute convertUML for flowcharts and for sequence diagrams. Notice that convertUML can handle both the < pre >< code > format or the < div > format we mentioned earlier. The actual convertUML function reads UML instructions from our element and sticks it in a div that gets appended to our main HTML content (in this case we look for the the body tag, but it could be anything).

Normally Python Markdown does not parse content inside HTML tags unless they are marked with the attribute markdown='1' . But since this is run as a preprocessor, it is not aware of the HTML blocks. SuperFences is made to work with the default extensions out of the box. It will probably not work with other extensions such as Grid Tables, since that extension allows for characters to obscure the blocks like the blockquote syntax does (though this has been designed to work with blockquotes). Ideally fenced blocks need to be handled by a block parser, but there is much work to be done on Python Markdown's internal block handlers before this is possible. SuperFences works best when following the guidelines. If the guidelines are not followed, odd results may be encountered. For the reasons above, the nested fences feature really is just a workaround. But for a lot of people, this functionality is more than sufficient. Options Option Type Default Description css_class string '' Class name is applied to the wrapper element of the code.

If the special parameter is set to a number n > 0, every n th line number is given the CSS class special . So to set showing only every other line number, we could do the following. Line options are separated by a space, and \"line step\" is always the second option, so you must specify line start before line step.

The default custom fences simply preserve the content between the fences so a JavaScript UML library can convert the content and render the UML. To see exactly how to set up UML like in this documentation, see UML Diagram Example . Custom fences are created via the custom_fences option. custom_fences takes an array of dictionaries where each dictionary defines a custom fence. The dictionaries requires the following keys: Keys Description name The language name that is specified when using the fence in Markdown.

When they are converted, the HTML element containing this content will have the respective classes uml-flowchart or uml-sequence-diagram . The format function we used in this example only escapes the content to be included in HTML. We will rely on JavaScript libraries to render our flowcharts/diagrams in the browser. The JavaScript libraries used to render UML in this document are flowchart.js and sequence-diagram.js . This extension does not provide these JavaScript libraries; you must provide the necessary JavaScript files for your custom fences yourself. If you wish to follow along with this example to enable UML, see the requirements below. flowcharts raphael.js flowchart.js sequence diagrams Minimum requirements for the latest version available via CDN (at the time of writing this). raphael.js underscore.js sequence-diagram.js All of the above mentioned libraries can be included using CDNs (you can use the version of your choice): < script src = \"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/raphael/2.2.7/raphael.min.js\" ></ script > < script src = \"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/underscore.js/1.8.3/underscore-min.js\" ></ script > < script src = \"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/js-sequence-diagrams/1.0.6/sequence-diagram-min.js\" ></ script > < script src = \"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/flowchart/1.6.5/flowchart.min.js\" ></ script > Simply including the libraries above is not enough as these libraries need to be pointed at the elements they need to convert. Also, we need to configure the libraries with the settings we would like. As mentioned earlier, our flowchart elements have the uml-flowchart class assigned to them, and the sequence diagram elements have the uml-sequence-diagram class assigned to them. Below shows an example script to convert the UML diagrams for both flowcharts and sequence diagrams using the listed libraries above. This script will target the elements with the classes uml-flowchart and uml-sequence-diagram . The script will pass the content to the correct library to render the content. It will then insert the rendered UML and remove the original source. This is just an example, and you are not required to use the following script. You are free to modify the example script or write your own to suite your specific custom fence. In the below example we create an onReady function to execute the conversion when the HTML is loaded. We create a convertUML function that takes the class name to search for, the converter to use, and a settings object to feed into the converter. We then call onReady and feed it a callback function that will execute convertUML for flowcharts and for sequence diagrams. Notice that convertUML can handle both the < pre >< code > format or the < div > format we mentioned earlier. The actual convertUML function reads UML instructions from our element and sticks it in a div that gets appended to our main HTML content (in this case we look for the the body tag, but it could be anything).

Styling In order to use tabbed blocks, some additional CSS is needed. You can check out the configuration below which will show the CSS and the HTML it targets. Keep in mind the CSS is just the minimum to get you started. You can tweak it and modify it to get it how you like it. In general, tabbed controls are wrapped in a < div > with the class tabbed-set . They contain an < input > with an ID of __tabbed_<tab_set_number>_<tab_number> . All the < input > elements from a specific tab set will use the name __tabbed_<tab_set_number> .
