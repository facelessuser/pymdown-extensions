They were originally written to make writing documentation more enjoyable. They cover a wide range of solutions, and while not every extension is needed by all people, there is usually at least one useful extension for everybody. Usage All extensions are found under the module namespace of pymdownx . Assuming we wanted to specify the use of the MagicLink extension, we would include it in Python Markdown like so: >>> import markdown >>> text = \"A link https://google.com\" >>> html = markdown . markdown ( text , extensions = [ 'pymdownx.magiclink' ]) '<p>A link <a href=\"https://google.com\">https://google.com</a></p>' Check out documentation on each extension to learn more about how to configure and use each one. Reminder Please read the Usage Notes for information on extension compatibility and general notes to be aware of when using these extensions. Extensions Arithmatex Arithmatex is an extension that preserves LaTeX math equations ( \\(\\frac{\\sqrt x}{y^3}\\) ) during the Markdown conversion process so that they can be used with MathJax . B64 B64 converts all local images in a document to base64 encoding and embeds them in the document. BetterEm BetterEm is a different approach to emphasis than Python Markdown's default. It works similar but handles certain corner cases differently. Caret Caret is an extension that is syntactically built around the ^ character. It adds support for inserting super scripts and adds an easy way to place text in an < ins > tag. Critic Critic adds handling and support of Critic Markup . Details Details creates collapsible elements with < details >< summary > tags. Click Me! Thanks! Emoji Emoji makes adding emoji via Markdown easy . EscapeAll EscapeAll allows the escaping of any character, some with additional effects. Check it out to learn more. Extra Extra is just like Python Markdown's Extra package except it uses PyMdown Extensions to substitute similar extensions. Highlight Highlight allows you to configure the syntax highlighting of SuperFences and InlineHilite . Also passes standard Markdown indented code blocks through the syntax highlighter. InlineHilite InlineHilite highlights inline code: from module import function as func . Keys Keys makes inserting key inputs into documents as easy as pressing Ctrl \uff0b Alt \uff0b Del . MagicLink MagicLink linkafies URL and email links without having to wrap them in Markdown syntax. Also, shortens repository issue, pull request, and commit links automatically for popular code hosting providers. You can even use special shorthand syntax to link to issues, diffs, and even mention people Mark Mark allows you to mark words easily. PathConverter PathConverter converts paths to absolute or relative to a given base path. ProgressBar ProgressBar creates progress bars quick and easy. SaneHeaders SaneHeaders modifies hash headers to only be evaluated if the starting hash symbols are followed by at least one space. This is useful if you use other extensions that also use the hash symbol (like our own MagicLink extension). SmartSymbols SmartSymbols inserts commonly used Unicode characters via simple ASCII representations: =/= \u2192 \u2260. Snippets Snippets include other Markdown or HTML snippets into the current Markdown file being parsed. StripHTML StripHTML can strip out HTML comments and specific tag attributes. SuperFences SuperFences is like Python Markdown's fences, but better. Nest fences under lists, admonitions, and other syntaxes. You can even create special custom fences for content like UML.

Pymdown Extensions has a number of extensions that expose customization via options that take function references. If you are using a project like MkDocs , which allows a user to configure Python Markdown extensions via YAML, specifying function references may not be intuitive.

NEW : PathConverter: Add option to use file:// prefix on absolute paths. FIX : Highlight: Ensure that extend_pygments_lang is not case sensitive regarding language names. 9.2 NEW : Drop Python 3.6 support and formally add Python 3.10 support. NEW : Highlight: Add pygments_lang_option to enable attaching language classes to Pygments code blocks. NEW : SuperFences: Custom fence validators and formatters can now be forced to raise an exception by raising a SuperFencesException . NEW : Keys: Add power and fingerprint keys. FIX : SuperFences: Fix case where custom fence in a blockquote was not gracefully handled. FIX : Arithmatex: fix issue where if you limit the inline or block syntax to specific input types, access to certain matched groups could cause an error. 9.1 NEW : Highlight: If linenums is enabled globally via the highlight extension, and a code block specifies a line number of zero (e.g. SuperFences), disable line numbers for that code block. FIX : Snippets: Add missing documentation for auto_append feature that was added in 8.2. FIX : Highlight: When attr_list is enabled, attributes were not properly added to Pygments code blocks in the table format. ( #1505 ) 9.0 Please see Migration Notes for details on upgrading to 9.0. NEW : Arithmatex: Wrap MathJax \"script\" format (non-preview) with a container element just like all other Arithmatex output formats. NEW : Arithmatex: MathJax (non-generic) form's container element now has the arithmatex class added just like everywhere else. NEW : Arithmatex: Add options to override HTML element container type of inline and block math. NEW : Arithmatex: Add new formatter functions intended to replace old math fenced/inline block formatters. New formatter functions are configurable. All others are marked as deprecated and will be removed at some future date. NEW : Emoji: Upgraded Twitter emoji database to support latest emoji. It is a known issue that Twitter has :man_in_santa_hat: and :mx_claus: backwards \u2013 same for :mrs_claus: and :woman_in_santa_hat: . That is on Twitter's side, not ours. NEW : Highlight: Add support for the Pygments option linespans . NEW : Highlight: Add support for Pygments option lineanchors . NEW : Highlight: Add support for Pygments option anchorlinenos . NEW : Highlight: Remove legacy_no_wrap_code option. NEW : Add support for generating title headers pulled from the Pygments lexer for code blocks. Feature can be enabled via the new auto_title option. If a specific name is not preferred, these names can be overridden via a user defined mapping called auto_title_map . NEW : SuperFences: Allow setting a title, or overriding an auto title via the new title option in a fenced code header. NEW : SuperFences: Allow adding ID and arbitrary data- attributes on Pygments code blocks. The latter requires the attr_list extension to be enabled. NEW : SuperFences: Removed old deprecated option highlight_code which no longer did anything. NEW : SuperFences: Remove legacy code meant to help with transitioning to new custom fence function format. NEW : Tabbed: New alternate style that allows for a scrollable tabs if they overflow. Feature is experimental, see docs for more information. NEW : Slugs: Add new configurable slugify function that aims to replace all other slugify methods. Deprecate uslugify , uslugify_encoded , uslugify_case , uslugify_case_encoded , gfm , and gfm_encoded . slugify takes parameters returning a function that performs the desired slug handling. slugify adds new options case=\"fold\" for case folding and normalize='<normalize format here>' (uses NFC by default). FIX : BetterEm: Fix some complex cases related to \"smart\" logic. ( #1413 ) FIX : EscapeAll: Fix issue where an escaped HTML entity may end up with incorrect slug and incorrect table of content entry. FIX : Highlight: Fix issue that occurs when showing only nth line numbers and using pymdownx-inline . Lines not showing a line number would not render with the proper leading space. 8.2 NEW : Snippets: now accepts a list of base paths which will be resolved in the order they are specified. Compatibility is present with legacy behavior, and a single string path will still be accepted. NEW : Snippets: allow for specifying certain snippets to auto-append to every file. Useful for appending abbreviations, reference links, etc. NEW : Snippets: a snippet base path can be a full path to a file. When a base path is a full path to a file, only that file will be included from the specified folder. This allows for targeting a one off file outside of the normal snippet paths(s). NEW : MagicLink: add GitHub Discussions support to MagicLink. Can now use ?<num> to link discussions. Full discussion links will also be shortened if shortening is enabled. ( #1187 ) NEW : MagicLink: add new normalize_issue_symbols option to make issues, pull request, and discussion links all render with # instead of # , ! , and ? respectively. Input syntax is still the same. Great if you want a GitHub style look where all issue types are just rendered with # . FIX : MagicLink: documentation will not render links with special icons added via CSS so as not to confuse users that may think that is part of MagicLink. While possible with CSS, MagicLink provides no CSS automatically. FIX : Tabbed & Details: Fix corner case with lists. ( #1225 ) FIX : Fix issue with unescaping logic in code blocks. 8.1.1 FIX : Ensure content immediately before Details content or Tabbed content gets preserved. FIX : StripHTML: Fix some corner cases related to stripping comments. 8.1 NEW : Drop support for Python 3.5. NEW : Officially support Python 3.9. NEW : Tabbed titles can now have simple Markdown in them which can be parsed and rendered (like emoji, bold, etc.). FIX : Avoid parsing script tags in PathConverter and B64 extensions. 8.0.1 FIX : Fix issue with pymdownx-inline an Pygments 2.7+. 8.0 Please see Migration Notes for details on upgrading to 8.0. NEW : Added SaneHeaders extension. NEW : SuperFences & InlineHilite: gracefully handle failing custom formatters and/or validators. Users should add their own debug code to their formatter/validator if they suspect it isn't working. NEW : SuperFences: if a custom fence validator fails, try the next custom fence until all are exhausted. NEW : SuperFences: no longer allow custom options in the form key= (no value). Only keys with values or keys with no value and no = are accepted. Keys with no value will now assume the value to be the key name. NEW : SuperFences: if attr_list extension is enabled, fenced code that use brace attribute list style headers ( ```{lang #id .class attr=value} ) will attach arbitrary attributes that are included in the header to the code element. NEW : SuperFences: when Pygments is disabled, options (such as linenums ) included in fenced code headers no longer do anything. If attr_list is enabled, and the brace header is used, such options will be treated as HTML attributes. JavaScript highlighter options should be defined in the brace header form with attr_list enabled in order to generate appropriate, compatible HTML with the chosen JavaScript highlighter. NEW : SuperFences: backwards incompatible changes where made to custom fence API. See Migration Notes for instructions on how to migrate to the new API. Some temporary support for most of the old format is in place, but is deprecated. NEW : SuperFences: has removed legacy code tab feature. Associated legacy_tab_classes option has been removed. Please use the Tabbed extension to create general purpose tabs for code blocks or other content. NEW : Highlight: add new option language_prefix which controls the prefix applied to language classes when Pygments is not being used. NEW : Highlight: A new option called code_attr_on_pre was added to the Highlight extension and controls whether language classes, and any ids, attributes, and classes that are defined in fenced code attribute list style headers, are attached to the code element or pre element. This has effect when using Pygments. NEW : Highlight: option linenums now defaults to None and accepts None , True , or False . None is disabled by default, but can be enabled per code block. True enables line numbers globally. False disables globally and cannot be enabled manually per code block. NEW : ExtraRawHTML: remove extension. FIX : Fix issues with complex emphasis combinations in BetterEm. FIX : Details: fix corner cases related to extension and lists. FIX : Tabbed: fix corner cases related to extension and lists. FIX : EscapeAll: Handle HTML entities special. FIX : SuperFences: Fix parameter unpacking bug. 7.1 NEW : SuperFences will now allow number ranges in hl_lines option. ( #878 ) NEW : Emoji extension now requires custom emoji indexes to take an options and md argument. The old non-argument format is deprecated and still accepted, but support for indexes with no arguments will be removed at a future time. NEW : Highlight now allows the specifying of a custom line number class when not using Pygments. FIX : Better Arithmatex patterns. Fix issue #888 which caused a hang due to a regular expression typo. Also ensure $$ .. $$ and begin {} ...end {} patterns properly don't match if the tail markers are escaped. 7.0 Please see Migration Notes for details on upgrading to 7.0. NEW : MagicLink will now shorten user name and repository links when link shortening is enabled. NEW : Added MagicLink options social_url_shortener and shortener_user_exclude were added. NEW : UML examples are now demonstrated with Mermaid in documentation. NEW : SuperFences, if using the attribute list format ( ``` {.lang .additional_class, linenums=\"1\"} ) allows adding additional classes. IDs can be added as well, though Pygments generated code blocks do not have a mechanism to actually insert IDs. The first provided class will always be treated as the language class. NEW : Custom SuperFences' formatters should now also include the keyword parameters classes and id_value to allow injecting classes and IDs via the now supported attribute list format. If a code block defines no additional IDs and classes, the old form will be used. Formatters should include **kwargs at the end to future proof them from future changes. NEW : Deprecate the SuperFences highight_code option. As SuperFences syntax has language classes built right in, disabling the highlight_code option makes little sense. While highlight_code is still accepted, it currently does nothing and will be removed at some future time. NEW : If a custom fence (SuperFences) or inline (InlineHilite) is given the name of * , it will override the default fence logic. NEW : SuperFences and InlineHilite no longer sync settings from CodeHilite. NEW : Add new Tabbed extension for general purpose tabbed content in Markdown. NEW : Deprecate old SuperFences tabbed content feature. This will be removed in 8.0. NEW : SuperFences' tabbed content classes have changed from supferfences-tabs and superfences-content to tabbed-set and tabbed-content respectively. Old style classes can be enabled with the legacy_tab_classes option in SuperFences. This new option will be retired with SuperFences tabbed content feature in 8.0. NEW : Upgrade to Twemoji 12.1.5. NEW : New key codes and key code changes in Keys extension: Added super , left-super , and right-super key codes as an alternative to meta . Aliases lsuper and rsuper were also added. Added the alt-graph key code with altgr alias. Added the following new aliases: lwindows and rwindows for consistency. Added new codes left-meta and right-meta for consistency with other modifiers.

Coding Standards When writing code, the code should roughly conform to PEP8 and PEP257 suggestions. The PyMdown Extensions project utilizes the Flake8 linter (with some additional plugins) to ensure code conforms (give or take some of the rules). When in doubt follow the formatting hints of existing code when adding or modifying files. existing files. Listed below are the modules used: pycqa/flake8 pycqa/flake8-docstrings pycqa/pep8-naming ebeweber/flake8-mutable gforcada/flake8-builtins Flake8 can be run directly via the command line from the root of the project. flake8 Building and Editing Documents Documents are in Markdown (with some additional syntax) and converted to HTML via Python Markdown and this extension bundle. If you would like to build and preview the documentation, you must have these packages installed: Python-Markdown/markdown : the Markdown parser. mkdocs/mkdocs : the document site generator. squidfunk/mkdocs-material : a material theme for MkDocs. timvink/mkdocs-git-revision-date-localized-plugin : inserts date a page was last updated. facelessuser/pymdown-extensions : this Python Markdown extension bundle. These can be installed via: pip install -r requirements/docs.txt In order to build and preview the documents, just run the command below from the root of the project and you should be able to view the documents at localhost:8000 in your browser. After that, you should be able to update the documents and have your browser preview update live. mkdocs serve Editing Document Theme It isn't expected that people will need to mess with the theme, but if it is needed, a little additional work is required. The documents use the Material theme for MkDocs with some additional local tweaks and additions. JavaScript additions are provided in docs/src/js and are in es2020 syntax and are converted to es5. Stylesheets are located at docs/src/scss and are written in SCSS, and are converted to CSS. All conversions are done in a Node.js environment. In order to get up and running, ensure you have a Node.js version >= 10. Then install the required modules with: npm install After that you can begin making changes. When ready, you can run the following commands to get a live preview while you make edits, lint your changes, or build the final output. Commands Description npm run serve Create a live preview at localhost:8000 that will pick up your changes as you make them. npm run build Build the final output which will package, minimize, and revision the scripts and stylesheets. It will also update the mkdocs.yml file to point to the new revisioned files. npm run lint Run just lint on the files. npm run clean_all This will clean out the generated CSS and JavaScript files. It will also cleanup the generated MkDocs' site. If you need to make changes to the mkdocs.yml file, do not update the one in project root directly, but update the one in docs/src . The build environment copies the one in docs/src to the project root and injects the revisioned script name(s) and stylesheet name(s). When serving via npm , if you want to make sure that the local version of pymdown-extensions is used, you need to configure npm run serve to call with Python instead of calling the MkDocs binary: npm run serve --mkdocs=\"python3 -m mkdocs\" . This is because if you are calling Python, it will look in the current working directory first for a given module when importing, but if you call the MkDocs binary, it will instead import the installed pymdown-extensions . Configuring the --mkdocs option is also useful if mkdocs is not in your path, or you want to call with a specific version of Python. Spell Checking Documents During validation, we build the docs and run a spell checker on them. The spell checker uses facelessuser/pyspelling and Aspell . As it can be trickier to run Aspell under Windows, it is not expected that everyone will install and run the spell checker locally. In order to perform the spell check, it is expected you are setup to build the documents, and that you have Aspell installed in the your system path. If you wish to run the spell checker locally, the recommended way is with Tox, which is covered in \"Running Validation With Tox\" . You can also run the spell checker by first installing the requirements (assuming a Linux system): pip install -r requirements/docs.txt sudo apt-get install aspell aspell-en Then build the docs: mkdocs build --clean And then run the spell checker: pyspelling It should print out the files with the misspelled words if any are found. If you find it prints words that are not misspelled, you can add them in the dictionary which is found in docs/src/dictionary . Validation Tests In order to preserve good code health, a test suite has been put together with pytest ( pytest-dev/pytest ). There are currently two kinds of tests: syntax and targeted. To run these tests, you can use the following command: If you wish to run the tests locally, the recommended way is with Tox, which is covered in \"Running Validation With Tox\" . You can also run the tests by first installing the requirements: pip install -r requirements/project.txt pip install -r requirements/extra.txt pip install -r requirements/test.txt And then run the tests with: python run_tests.py Syntax Syntax tests are essentially text files containing Markdown. They are found under tests/extensions . test_syntax.py scans all the files and converts the files to HTML with the extensions and options defined in tests/extensions/tests.yml . They are then compared to the current stored HTML output. If the two differ, the test fails. To run only these tests, from the root of the project run the following command: python run_tests.py --test-target syntax You could also run them directly with: py.test tests/test_syntax.py To run a specific syntax test: python run_tests.py --test-target syntax --file tests/extensions/arithmatex.txt To accept the differences in tests due to a change(s) you made, you can run the following command: python run_tests.py --update To update and accept the differences in a single test: python run_tests.py --update --file tests/extensions/arithmatex.txt Targeted Targeted tests are unit tests that target specific areas in the code and exercises them to ensure proper functionality. These tests are found in test_targeted.py . You can run only these tests from the root of the project with: python run_tests.py --test-target targeted You could also run them directly with: py.test tests/test_targeted.py Running Validation With Tox Tox ( tox-dev/tox ) is a great way to run the validation tests, spelling checks, and linting in virtual environments so as not to mess with your current working environment. Tox will use the specified Python version for the given environment and create a virtual environment and install all the needed requirements (minus Aspell). You could also setup your own virtual environments with the Virtualenv module without Tox, and manually do the same. First, you need to have Tox installed: pip install tox By running Tox, it will walk through all the environments and create them (assuming you have all the python versions on your machine) and run the related tests. See tox.ini to learn more. tox If you don't have all the Python versions needed to test all the environments, those entries will fail. You can ignore those. Spelling will also fail if you don't have the correct version of Aspell. To target a specific environment to test, you use the -e option to select the environment of interest. To select lint: tox -e lint To select Python 3.7 unit tests (or other versions \u2013 change accordingly): tox -e py37 To select spelling and document building: tox -e documents Code Coverage When running the validation tests through Tox, it is setup to track code coverage via the Coverage ( ned/coveragepy ) module. Coverage is run on each pyxx environment. If you've made changes to the code, you can clear the old coverage data: coverage erase Then run each unit test environment to and coverage will be calculated. All the data from each run is merged together. HTML is output for each file in .tox/pyXX-unittests/tmp . You can use these to see areas that are not covered/exercised yet with testing. You can checkout tox.ini to see how this is accomplished. Generating Emoji Indexes The Emoji extension has emoji indexes generated from the source of Gemoji, EmojiOne, and Twemoji. Below is the process for auto-generating these indexes. In the case of Twemoji, it will also reference EmojiOne's short name index, so you may need to do both EmojiOne and Twemoji if the support is not satisfactory. Ensure you have Requests ( requests/requests ) installed: pip install requests . Fork the repository and checkout to your machine. Navigate to the root of the project. Call the generator script: python tools/gen_emoji.py --gemoji , python tools/gen_emoji.py --emojione , or python tools/gen_emoji.py --twemoji . If you already have the latest tag locally, you can specify --no-download . It will prompt you to select a tag to download and/or use. Please pull the latest official tag. Please don't pull experimental tags. This should update the indexes. Then you want to update the tests. Force the tests to update via python run_tests.py --update . Make sure only the emoji tests get updated. Nothing is fool proof. If they make a breaking change to the files that the script parses, or the location of the files change, the auto-update tool may need to be updated itself (hopefully this would be a rare occurrence). If such a change does occur, and you are feeling brave, a pull request would be appreciated, but in time, they will be resolved regardless.","title":"Development"},{"location":"about/development/#development","text":"","title":"Development"},{"location":"about/development/#project-layout","text":"There are a number of files for build, test, and continuous integration in the root of the project, but in general, the project is broken up like so. \u251c\u2500\u2500 docs \u251c\u2500\u2500 pymdownx \u251c\u2500\u2500 requirements \u251c\u2500\u2500 tests \u2514\u2500\u2500 tools Directory Description docs This contains the source files for the documentation. pymdownx This contains the source code for all the extensions. requirements This contains files with lists of dependencies required dependencies for continuous integration. tests This contains the various tests that are run in order to ensure code health. tools This contains various tools that are necessary during development.","title":"Project Layout"},{"location":"about/development/#coding-standards","text":"When writing code, the code should roughly conform to PEP8 and PEP257 suggestions.

In order to get up and running, ensure you have a Node.js version >= 10. Then install the required modules with: npm install After that you can begin making changes. When ready, you can run the following commands to get a live preview while you make edits, lint your changes, or build the final output. Commands Description npm run serve Create a live preview at localhost:8000 that will pick up your changes as you make them. npm run build Build the final output which will package, minimize, and revision the scripts and stylesheets. It will also update the mkdocs.yml file to point to the new revisioned files. npm run lint Run just lint on the files. npm run clean_all This will clean out the generated CSS and JavaScript files. It will also cleanup the generated MkDocs' site. If you need to make changes to the mkdocs.yml file, do not update the one in project root directly, but update the one in docs/src . The build environment copies the one in docs/src to the project root and injects the revisioned script name(s) and stylesheet name(s). When serving via npm , if you want to make sure that the local version of pymdown-extensions is used, you need to configure npm run serve to call with Python instead of calling the MkDocs binary: npm run serve --mkdocs=\"python3 -m mkdocs\" . This is because if you are calling Python, it will look in the current working directory first for a given module when importing, but if you call the MkDocs binary, it will instead import the installed pymdown-extensions . Configuring the --mkdocs option is also useful if mkdocs is not in your path, or you want to call with a specific version of Python.","title":"Editing Document Theme"},{"location":"about/development/#spell-checking-documents","text":"During validation, we build the docs and run a spell checker on them.

Some previously deprecated features are now removed: tabbed code blocks via SuperFences and ExtraRawHTML. These were originally deprecated as they are now redundant, and information is provided to allow you to get the same behavior as before. One of the most invasive changes was adding the support of defining arbitrary attributes on code blocks in SuperFences via the brace header format. This caused numerous changes that affects those who define their own custom fences. If you are only using the builtin fences provided by SuperFences, you will likely notice no adverse affects, but will be able to take advantage of new the new features being offered. Better Support for JS Highlighters SuperFences adds the ability, when using the brace header format ( ```{.lang .class #id attr=value} ) to add arbitrary HTML attributes to code blocks. By default, all classes, IDs and and attributes are added to the code block of the generated output. The one exception is that the default highlight class is always added to the top level element. For instance, if a user needed to specify that a line number starts with an attribute data-linenum-start , they could simply use the brace header format to define this new attribute: ```{.python data-linenum-start=\"30\"} import sys ``` Attributes will only be used when Python Markdown's attr_list extension is enabled. Attributes will also be ignored when using Pygments as Pygments doesn't directly support adding IDs or arbitrary attributes. This allows for more extensive configuration when using JavaScript highlighters. Now users can set the appropriate attributes to configure line numbers and other highlighter specific features without the Highlight extension getting in the way. Some JS highlighters may require attributes and classes to be assigned to the pre element, so the Highlight extension has added a new feature called code_attr_on_pre . This new option will ensure that custom classes, IDs, and attributes are applied to the pre element instead. By default, JavaScript ready code blocks would normally have the specified language class prefixed with language- . This follows the HTML 5 specification, but some highlighters may prefer something different. The prefix can now be changed with the new Highlight option called language_prefix . Retired Features The legacy tab feature has been removed from SuperFences. This does not mean tab support is dead as the Tabbed extension actually provides an even more useful, general purpose, solution. It was impossible to keep this legacy feature around, in its current implementation, after the restructure of for attribute list support, so we decided to officially retire this already deprecated feature. ExtraRawHTML has officially been removed. This extension only existed because Python Markdown did not have the feature exposed in a manner that allowed you to use it without including all of their \"Extra\" extension, now that Python Markdown has exposed this extension by itself, there is no longer a reason for us expose it via ExtraRawHTML. Please use Python Markdown's md_in_html extension instead to get the same exact functionality. Custom Fence Changes SuperFences made numerous changes so that users who wish not to use Pygments can set arbitrary attributes via the brace header format so that can more extensively configure their code blocks for JavaScript syntax highlighters. This required changes to how custom fences were handled. Custom fence formatters are now expected to take a new keyword attribute called attrs . attrs contains a dictionary of key/value pairs defining attributes that should be attached to the main block element generated by a given formatter. In general, custom formatters should handle these, but are not required to. At the very least, they should be updated to take the argument even if they don't do anything with them. Custom fences that do not accept this parameter will silently fail. If your custom fence already accepts **kwargs (as recommended in the 7.0 release), your fence should continue to work even you do not do anything with the attributes. No use and apply the new, attributes, you will have to read the attrs parameter and set those to one of the elements in your generated HTML. Custom fence validators have been updated to handle validation of inputs by assigning valid inputs to either an options dictionary or an attrs dictionary. The new function signature looks like this: validator ( language , inputs , options , attrs , md ): . inputs contains all the parsed key/value pairs and should never be modified. options should have inputs added to it that configure a formatter's features. You should parse, format and assign all inputs that are considered options to the option dictionary. attrs normally would contain copies of any non-option key/value pairs from inputs, unaltered. These would usually be applied to HTML elements as attributes. md is the Markdown class instance and is useful if you want to access meta data or anything else in your validator. SuperFences will detect if you are using an older validator and should gracefully transition and use the old format, but it is strongly recommended to use the new format. If you run into any issues, you are required to update to the new format. In a future version, the graceful transition will be removed. Since attributes and options are now parsed via the attr_list extension, custom fences can no longer allow inputs in the form key= (with no value), they must be in the form key , key=\"value\" or key=value . When defining an input in the form key (with no value), the value will be the key name (this is how attr_list handles such cases). To specify an empty key , please use key=\"\" . If a custom validator fails, SuperFences will now gracefully handle the error and try the next custom fence in the queue. If a custom formatter fails. If you suspect your custom validator is not working, you should add your own debug code to your custom fence to verify whether it is failing or not. SuperFences will gracefully handle the error and abort processing the fence. If you suspect your custom formatter is not working, you should add your own debug code to your custom fence to verify whether it is failing or not. New Extension SaneHeaders implements Markdown headers more like CommonMark. Headers require a space after the # symbol in order for the line to be treated as a header. This allows you to use MagicLink issues at the start of a line.

Attributes will also be ignored when using Pygments as Pygments doesn't directly support adding IDs or arbitrary attributes. This allows for more extensive configuration when using JavaScript highlighters. Now users can set the appropriate attributes to configure line numbers and other highlighter specific features without the Highlight extension getting in the way. Some JS highlighters may require attributes and classes to be assigned to the pre element, so the Highlight extension has added a new feature called code_attr_on_pre . This new option will ensure that custom classes, IDs, and attributes are applied to the pre element instead. By default, JavaScript ready code blocks would normally have the specified language class prefixed with language- . This follows the HTML 5 specification, but some highlighters may prefer something different. The prefix can now be changed with the new Highlight option called language_prefix .","title":"Better Support for JS Highlighters"},{"location":"about/releases/8.0/#retired-features","text":"The legacy tab feature has been removed from SuperFences.

ExtraRawHTML has officially been removed. This extension only existed because Python Markdown did not have the feature exposed in a manner that allowed you to use it without including all of their \"Extra\" extension, now that Python Markdown has exposed this extension by itself, there is no longer a reason for us expose it via ExtraRawHTML.

This required changes to how custom fences were handled. Custom fence formatters are now expected to take a new keyword attribute called attrs . attrs contains a dictionary of key/value pairs defining attributes that should be attached to the main block element generated by a given formatter. In general, custom formatters should handle these, but are not required to. At the very least, they should be updated to take the argument even if they don't do anything with them. Custom fences that do not accept this parameter will silently fail. If your custom fence already accepts **kwargs (as recommended in the 7.0 release), your fence should continue to work even you do not do anything with the attributes. No use and apply the new, attributes, you will have to read the attrs parameter and set those to one of the elements in your generated HTML. Custom fence validators have been updated to handle validation of inputs by assigning valid inputs to either an options dictionary or an attrs dictionary. The new function signature looks like this: validator ( language , inputs , options , attrs , md ): . inputs contains all the parsed key/value pairs and should never be modified. options should have inputs added to it that configure a formatter's features. You should parse, format and assign all inputs that are considered options to the option dictionary. attrs normally would contain copies of any non-option key/value pairs from inputs, unaltered. These would usually be applied to HTML elements as attributes. md is the Markdown class instance and is useful if you want to access meta data or anything else in your validator. SuperFences will detect if you are using an older validator and should gracefully transition and use the old format, but it is strongly recommended to use the new format. If you run into any issues, you are required to update to the new format. In a future version, the graceful transition will be removed. Since attributes and options are now parsed via the attr_list extension, custom fences can no longer allow inputs in the form key= (with no value), they must be in the form key , key=\"value\" or key=value . When defining an input in the form key (with no value), the value will be the key name (this is how attr_list handles such cases). To specify an empty key , please use key=\"\" . If a custom validator fails, SuperFences will now gracefully handle the error and try the next custom fence in the queue. If a custom formatter fails. If you suspect your custom validator is not working, you should add your own debug code to your custom fence to verify whether it is failing or not. SuperFences will gracefully handle the error and abort processing the fence. If you suspect your custom formatter is not working, you should add your own debug code to your custom fence to verify whether it is failing or not.","title":"Custom Fence Changes"},{"location":"about/releases/8.0/#new-extension","text":"SaneHeaders implements Markdown headers more like CommonMark.

This guide will touch on migration concerns related to removals, deprecations, and/or breaking changes. In general, there should be no breaking changes in 9.0 unless you were still using old, already deprecated features. Gone & Deprecated Removed deprecated features: Highlight's legacy_no_wrap_code option was removed. This used to allow people to output code blocks in Pygments' original way, which simply inserted code in a < pre > block. This was added all the way back in 6.3 and was only added to help transition people to the new output which is HTML5 compatible and wraps code in < pre >< code > blocks. If you have styling or logic that depending on this old, deprecated option, you will have to update said styles and/or script logic to account for the new output. Highlight's highlight_code option has formally been removed. This option as been a NOOP for a long time and was just left around in order to not break people's usage of Highlight. It has now been removed. If it was still hanging around in your config, it should simply be removed. Nothing functionally will change. SuperFences, in 7.0, changed up the format of the custom fences. When custom fences were added, a full vision of how they would/should be used had not fully cemented, so unfortunately they have been revised occasionally, 7.0 being the most recent time. To help transition people, a fallback was left in with a warning. This fallback code has now been removed. Information regarding how to upgrade the format is available in the 7.0 release guide . As far as deprecated functions and features are concerned: Arithmatex has deprecated all of its SuperFences custom fence functions and instead has replaced it with two configurable methods. MkDocs users may have some concerns that these will not work in the YAML configuration, but fear not as things work just fine. Check out Arithmatex Custom Fences for more info. PyMdown Extensions provided a number of slugify functions which, like with Arithmatex, have been consolidated into a single configurable function. With this consolidation, two new options have been added that allow applying Python's default case folding on slugs and allow configuring Unicode normalization. Personally, we feel NFC is the way to go, but if others disagree, this is now configurable. Check out One Slugify to Rule Them All . Much like the new Arithmatex formatters, these slugs, even though they are configurable, will work with MkDocs just fine. Arithmatex Arithmatex now as two new custom fences that can be used for InlineHilite and SuperFences: arithmatex_inline_format and arithmatex_fenced_format respectively. They can do everything the old methods can do and are configurable.

If you happen to use MkDocs with Arithmatex, and happen to use mkdocs-minify-plugin , you may notice that some math blocks don't render proper. This is because the plugin butchers white space in the wrapper < div > element. Now you can wrap your math in a < pre > and move on . This is configurable as an Arithmatex option called block_tag and inline_tag . The custom fences and formatters also have a tag option where this can be configured.

If you prefer to use something other than MathJax, Arithmatex can output a more generic format suitable for other libraries like KaTeX . Arithmatex searches for the patterns $ ... $ and \\( ... \\) for inline math, and $$ ... $$ , \\[ ... \\] , and \\begin {} ... \\end {} for block math. By default, all formats are enabled, but each format can individually be disabled if desired. The Arithmatex extension can be included in Python Markdown by using the following: import markdown md = markdown . Markdown ( extensions = [ 'pymdownx.arithmatex' ]) Input Format By default, smart_dollar mode is enabled for the $ ... $ inline variant. With smart_dollar it is expected that the opening token ( $ ) is to be followed by a non-whitespace character, and the closing to be preceded by a non-white-space character. This is to help avoid false positives when using the dollar sign in traditional ways such as: I have $2.00 and Bob has $10.00 . The previous statement requires no escaping of the $ character. But when needed, the $ character can be escaped using \\$ . smart_dollar can be disabled and will capture any $ ... $ whose dollar symbols are not escaped ( \\$ ). Inline Examples Output Markdown \\(p(x|y) = \\frac{p(y|x)p(x)}{p(y)}\\) , \\(p(x|y) = \\frac{p(y|x)p(x)}{p(y)}\\) . $ p ( x|y ) = \\frac {p ( y|x ) p ( x ) }{p ( y ) } $ , \\( p ( x|y ) = \\frac {p ( y|x ) p ( x ) }{p ( y ) } \\) . Inline Configuration When using MathJax, for best results, it is advised to not use generic mode, and configure MathJax without the text2jax extension since MathJax automatically detects Arithmatex's default output. If using generic mode (for libraries like KaTeX), Arithmatex will convert dollars to the form \\( ... \\) in the HTML output. This is because $ ... $ is extremely problematic to scan for, which is why MathJax and KaTeX disable $ ... $ by default in their plain text scanners, and why Arithmatex enables smart_dollar by default when scanning for $ ... $ . It is advised that if you are outputting in in generic mode that you do not configure your JavaScript library to look for $ ... $ and instead look for \\( ... \\) , and let Arithmatex's handle $ ... $ . For block forms, the block must start with the appropriate opening for the block type: $$ , \\[ , and \\begin {} for the respective search pattern. The block must also end with the proper respective end: $$ , \\] , and \\end {} . A block also must contain no empty lines and should be both preceded and followed by an empty line. Block Examples Output Markdown \\[ E(\\mathbf{v}, \\mathbf{h}) = -\\sum_{i,j}w_{ij}v_i h_j - \\sum_i b_i v_i - \\sum_j c_j h_j \\] \\[3 < 4\\] \\[\\begin{align} p(v_i=1|\\mathbf{h}) & = \\sigma\\left(\\sum_j w_{ij}h_j + b_i\\right) \\\\ p(h_j=1|\\mathbf{v}) & = \\sigma\\left(\\sum_i w_{ij}v_i + c_j\\right) \\end{align}\\] $$ E ( \\mathbf {v}, \\mathbf {h} ) = - \\sum _{i,j}w_{ij}v_i h_j - \\sum _i b_i v_i - \\sum _j c_j h_j $$ \\[ 3 < 4 \\] \\begin { align } p(v _ i=1| \\mathbf { h } ) & = \\sigma\\left ( \\sum _ j w _{ ij } h _ j + b _ i \\right ) \\\\ p(h _ j=1| \\mathbf { v } ) & = \\sigma\\left ( \\sum _ i w _{ ij } v _ i + c _ j \\right ) \\end { align } MathJax Output Format Form Dropped in MathJax 3 The title is a bit misleading. Yes, MathJax 3 dropped supporting the format as a default recognized form, but you can still use the form with MathJax 3, you just have to add a little more configuration. This used to be a supported format for MathJax 2. It appears this form was dropped in MathJax 3. While it is the current default for Arithmatex, it may be relegated to a secondary option in the future. If this output is preferred method, setting generic to False will prevent any surprises in the future if/when the default changes. The math equations will be wrapped in a special MathJax script tag and embedded into the HTML. This format does not require the tex2jax.js extension when setting up MathJax. The tag will be in the form of < script type = \"math/tex\" ></ script > for inline and < script type = \"math/tex; mode=display\" ></ script > for block. By default, Arithmatex will also generate a preview span with the class MathJax_Preview that can/should be hidden when the math content is actually loaded. If you do not want to generate the preview, simply set preview to False . All elements are additionally wrapped in a < div class = \"arithmatex\" ></ div > container by default ( span if outputting inline math). Generic Output Format If generic is enabled, the extension will escape necessary symbols and normalize all output to be wrapped in the more reliable \\( ... \\) for inline math and \\[ ... \\] for display math (unless changed via tex_inline_wrap and tex_block_wrap in the options ). Lastly, everything is inserted into a < span > or < div > for inline and display math respectively. With the default settings, if in your Markdown you used $ ... $ for inline math, it would be converted to < span class = \"arithmatex\" > \\(...\\) </ span > in the HTML. Blocks would be normalized from $$ ... $$ to < div class = \"arithmatex\" > \\[...\\] </ div > . In the case of \\begin {} ... \\end {} , begins and ends will not be replaced, only wrapped: < div class = \"arithmatex\" > \\[\\begin{}...\\end{}\\] </ div > . Loading MathJax Arithmatex requires you to provide the MathJax library and provide and configure it to your liking. The recommended way of including MathJax is to use the CDN. Latest version at time of writing this is found below. MathJax 3 Legacy: MathJax 2 < script src = \"https://polyfill.io/v3/polyfill.min.js?features=es6\" ></ script > < script src = \"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mathjax@3/es5/tex-chtml.js\" ></ script > < script src = \"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/mathjax/2.7.0/MathJax.js\" ></ script > Generally, it is best to add your own configuration to get exactly what you want. Here we show some simple examples of configurations done in JavaScript. We've provided two basic configurations below: one that is configured for Arithmatex's MathJax Output Format , and one that works with the Generic Output Format by using tex2jax . These are a good starting point, so feel free to take them and configure them further. Please see the MathJax site for more info on using MathJax extensions/plugins and configuring those extensions/plugins. As noted below, the non-generic methodology is more complicated in MathJax 3 as they abandoned the approach via wrapping math in script tags, but the solution is easily configurable as a simple copy/paste configuration.

We also don't bother adding $ ... $ and $$ ... $$ to the inlineMath and displayMath options as Arithmatex converts them respectively to \\( ... \\) and \\[ ... \\] in the HTML output (unless altered in Options ). But we do have to enable processEnvironments to properly process \\begin {} ... \\end {} blocks. Loading KaTeX In order to use KaTeX, the generic output format is required.

Both are configurable and effectively replace all other previously available formats. Deprecated 9.0 The old formatters inline_mathjax_format , inline_mathjax_preview_format , and inline_generic_format have all been deprecated and will be removed at some future time. It is advised to use the new arithmatex_inline_format which is configurable and will give the same results as the above three. InlineHilite and SuperFences both have a feature where you can specify your own custom inline and fence blocks respectively. Arithmatex provides a number of compatible formats that can be used in conjunction with InlineHilite and SuperFences to create an alternative (and possibly more preferable) syntax for math. In InlineHilite, by simply providing the following configuration (no need to include pymdownx.arithmatex as an extension), you can create a familiar inline math format: import pymdownx.arithmatex as arithmatex extensions = [ \"pymdownx.inlinehilite\" ] extension_config = { \"pymdownx.inlinehilite\" : { \"custom_inline\" : [ { \"name\" : \"math\" , \"class\" : \"arithmatex\" , \"format\" : arithmatex . arithmatex_inline_format ( which = \"generic\" )} ] } } YAML Configuration Format If you are attempting to configure these options in a YAML based configuration (like in MkDocs ), please see the FAQ to see how to specify function references in YAML.

Inline Configuration When using MathJax, for best results, it is advised to not use generic mode, and configure MathJax without the text2jax extension since MathJax automatically detects Arithmatex's default output. If using generic mode (for libraries like KaTeX), Arithmatex will convert dollars to the form \\( ... \\) in the HTML output. This is because $ ... $ is extremely problematic to scan for, which is why MathJax and KaTeX disable $ ... $ by default in their plain text scanners, and why Arithmatex enables smart_dollar by default when scanning for $ ... $ . It is advised that if you are outputting in in generic mode that you do not configure your JavaScript library to look for $ ... $ and instead look for \\( ... \\) , and let Arithmatex's handle $ ... $ .

This extension runs before all other extensions to parse the critic edits. Critic allows you to automatically accept edits or reject the edits and render the output accordingly. It also allows for visually displaying the changes in HTML output ( mileage may vary ). The Critic extension can be included in Python Markdown by using the following: import markdown md = markdown . Markdown ( extensions = [ 'pymdownx.critic' ]) Usage Critic Markup uses special markup to insert, delete, substitute, highlight, and comment. To insert or remove text you can use {++insert me++} and {--remove me--} respectively. You can also denote a substitution with {~~substitute this~>with this~~} . You can also highlight specific text with {==highlight me==} . Or even comment, which is generally done by highlighting text and following it with a comment: {==highlight me==}{>>Add a comment<<} . Critic Markup Accept Example Output Markdown Here is some Markdown. I am adding this here. Here is some more text. And here is even more text that I am adding.

If you need to reject critic marks or accept them, the Critic extension will work quite well. But when trying to render the edits visually and trying to convert the document to HTML, things can get ugly. I think this is the one unfortunate problem with CriticMarkup. The existence of the critic edits can alter the actual source. Its a fantastic idea, but it should be understood that when using CriticMarkup beyond inline or block paragraphs, there is a possibility that invalid HTML will be created for the preview (especially in relation to lists or if breaking up Markdown syntax). I think Fletcher of [MultiMarkdown][multi-markdown] said it best here: I view CriticMarkup as two things: A syntax for documenting editing notes and changes, and for collaborating amongst coauthors. A means to display those notes/changes in the HTML output. I believe that #1 is a really great idea, and well implemented. #2 is not so well implemented, largely due to the \"orthogonal\" nature of CriticMarkup and the underlying Markdown syntax. CM is designed as a separate layer on top of Markdown/MultiMarkdown. This means that a Markdown span could, for example, start in the middle of a CriticMarkup structure, but end outside of it. This means that an algorithm to properly convert a CM/Markdown document to HTML would be quite complex, with a huge number of edge cases to consider. I've tried a few (fairly creative, in my opinion) approaches, but they didn't work. Perhaps someone else will come up with a better solution, or will be so interested that they put the work in to create the complex algorithm. I have no current plans to do so. The Critic extension does its best by employing a preprocessor to inject the critic tags before all other parsing and a post-processor to clean up some of the weird side effects of the injection (only selected odd cases as others are more difficult to fix). It injects some classes into the edit region's HTML output which allows for CSS styling. There is probably a lot more post-processing that could be done to fix more issues, but whether this extension will be going further down that road has not yet been decided. CSS Critic renders the CriticMarkup with the following classes. Classes Description critic This is applied to all critic edits. break This is applied to critic inserts or deletes that encompass only 2+ newlines. block Applied to critic HTML tags that are detected as surrounding a block region. comment A CriticMarkup comment.

This is accomplished by using a short name index to map easy to remember names to associated Unicode data. The Unicode data is then converted into actual Unicode emoji characters and/or special HTML elements (usually images) that represent the emoji. Emoji Example Output Markdown :smile: :heart: :thumbsup: The Emoji extension can be included in Python Markdown by using the following: import markdown md = markdown . Markdown ( extensions = [ 'pymdownx.emoji' ]) Supported Emoji Providers There are a number of emoji short name conventions that people may be aware of. These conventions are always tied to a specific emoji set. These conventions differ because there is no official Unicode short name convention. At the present, Emoji chooses to focus on three specific emoji sets: EmojiOne Twemoji Gemoji EmojiOne ( ): EmojiOne is a high quality emoji set with support for gender and skin tone modifiers. Their free emoji set includes PNGs in sizes of 32x32, 64x64, and 128x128 which are all available via a CDN. The older EmojiOne (version 2.2.7), is what is used by default. It is the last truly free version. EmojiOne has rebranded with the name JoyPixels and now has an even more restrictive license for their graphical assets. Their latest short name list is still used for Twemoji as that portion is available under the MIT license via their toolkit repo JoyPixels/emoji-toolkit . Twemoji ( ): Twemoji is Twitter's open source emoji set which also covers a great many emoji with skin tones and gender modifiers. The hosted CDN provides 72x72 PNG emoji or SVG emoji. While Gemoji and EmojiOne have a short name convention, Twemoji does not, and there are very few 3 rd party projects that provide short names anywhere close to all the provided emoji that Twemoji supports. Since JoyPixels has an MIT licensed index of short names closest to what Twemoji supports, we use their short name list for Twemoji. There will be a reasonable attempt to patch in emoji not found in JoyPixels' index, but if JoyPixels is ever significantly behind, we may wait for JoyPixels to catch up. Gemoji ( ): Gemoji is GitHub's open source emoji solution. It contains a lot of common emoji and a couple special, non Unicode emoji (like Gemoji's :octocat: ). If you are a GitHub user, you are probably familiar with some of the short names associated with it. Their associated CDN contains the emoji in 75x75 PNG format. Emoji Image Licensing PyMdown Extensions has no affiliation with EmojiOne, Gemoji, or Twemoji. The indexes generated from their sources are covered under their respective licensing. When using their images or CSS, please see their licensing terms to ensure proper usage and attributions. EmojiOne Twemoji Gemoji joypixels/emoji-toolkit#joypixels-version-2 http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/ https://github.com/twitter/twemoji/blob/gh-pages/LICENSE-GRAPHICS https://github.com/github/gemoji/blob/master/LICENSE All short name indexes that Emoji uses are generated from EmojiOne's or Gemoji's latest official source tag \u2013 Twemoji uses JoyPixels' index as the Twemoji repository does not ship with a short name index. The indexes contain the emoji names, short names, values, etc.; everything needed to insert Unicode emoji characters or specially crafted HTML elements. Emoji Output Formats Depending on your needs, you may have different requirements for how emoji get displayed in your documents. You may want to use PNG images, or maybe you really like SVG images. Maybe you just want to convert short names to the actual Unicode code points. There are a variety of ways you may want to output emoji, and the Emoji extension has you covered. Emoji provides various output formats that take the Unicode data associated with a short name (or the short name itself in the case of a custom emoji) and generates an HTML output. Not all of the provided output formats will work for each emoji index, but there are a few that should work for all three. Check out Default Emoji Generators or Custom Emoji Generators to learn more. Default Emoji Indexes By default, Emoji provides three indexes: emojione , gemoji , and twemoji . All indexes are generated from the most recent official release tag source (in the case of Twemoji, short names are acquired from the generated index in JoyPixels/emoji-toolkit ). They can be used by passing in one of the three functions below via the emoji_index parameter. Pass the actual function reference, not a string. If you need to create your own, just check out Custom Emoji Indexes . Tip If you are attempting to configure these options in a YAML based configuration (like in MkDocs ), please see the FAQ to see how to specify function references in YAML. EmojiOne Twemoji Gemoji pymdownx.emoji.emojione This is the default function that is used. EmojiOne was rebranded as JoyPixels and is no longer permissible enough to be used. The release used here is for 2.2.7 which is the last usable, truly free version of EmojiOne. Users are still required to comply with acknowledgments. JoyPixels 3.0+ graphical assets will not be supported moving forward as the license is too restrictive, tough the latest index of their friendly names is supported under the MIT license and is used to generate friendly, short names for Twemoji. You can always find out what tag it was built with by doing the following: >>> import pymdownx.emoji1_db as e1db >>> e1db . version 'v2.2.7' To see the full list of short names for this index, see the index source . pymdownx.emoji.twemoji This function provides an index of the latest Twemoji supported emoji (at the time of release). The associated short names are currently borrowed from JoyPixels' index found in their JoyPixels/emoji-toolkit repo. JoyPixels short name index is available under the MIT license and is used as Twemoji does not provide its own list of short names. There are a few emoji that are currently Twemoji specific, two of which are likely to always be as they are not part of the official emoji spec. The short names are listed below. Twemoji Specific Emoji Twemoji provides some non-standard emoji. We've made them available following the naming patterns that EmojiOne follows as we are using their short name index. The emoji are either some that only Twemoji supports, rarely supported by others, or emoji that have tone and/or gender modifiers that aren't supported in the Unicode specifications. We've also provided appropriate aliases for consistency with other like emoji. :pirate_flag: :shibuya: :skier_tone1: :skier_tone2: :skier_tone3: :skier_tone4: :skier_tone5: :woman_levitate: :woman_levitate_tone1: :woman_levitate_tone2: :woman_levitate_tone3: :woman_levitate_tone4: :woman_levitate_tone5: :woman_in_business_suit_levitating_tone1: :woman_in_business_suit_levitating_tone2: :woman_in_business_suit_levitating_tone3: :woman_in_business_suit_levitating_tone4: :woman_in_business_suit_levitating_tone5: :woman_in_tuxedo: :woman_in_tuxedo_tone1: :woman_in_tuxedo_tone2: :woman_in_tuxedo_tone3: :woman_in_tuxedo_tone4: :woman_in_tuxedo_tone5: :transgender_sign: :transgender_flag: You can always find out what tag it was built with by doing the following: >>> import pymdownx.twemoji_db as twdb >>> twdb . version 'v12.1.3' >>> twdb . index_version '5.0.5' To see the full list of short names for this index, see the index source . pymdownx.emoji.gemoji This function provides an index of the latest Gemoji supported emoji (at the time of release). You can always find out what tag it was built with by doing the following: >>> import pymdownx.gemoji_db as gmdb >>> gmdb . version 'v3.0.1' To see the full list of short names for this index, see the index source . Default Emoji Generators Emoji provides six default emoji generators. PNG output and Unicode code point output are supported for all three indexes. SVG output is only supported for Twemoji and the older 2.2.7 EmojiOne set. PNG sprites and the \"Font Awesome\" like format are only supported by EmojiOne. SVG sprites is only supported by the 2.2.7 EmojiOne. You can select a generator to use by passing in one of the functions below via the emoji_generator parameter. Pass the actual function reference, not a string. If you need to create your own, just check out Custom Emoji Generators . Tip If you are attempting to configure these options in a YAML based configuration (like in MkDocs ), please see the FAQ to see how to specify function references in YAML. PNG SVG PNG Sprite SVG Sprite Alt pymdownx.emoji.to_png This is a general purpose generator which provides EmojiOne, GitHub, and Twemoji CDN path(s) out of the box. Depending on the index you've chosen, you the appropriate CDN will be provided. If this ever gets out of date, a new CDN can be passed in via image_path and/or non_standard_image_path . EmojiOne actually has multiple PNGs sizes of 32, 64, and 128, but the default CDN path is the one for size 64: https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/emojione/2.2.7/assets/png/64/ . You can change it for a larger or smaller PNG size by updating the size in the URL and passing the new URL in through image_path . The PNG output form is as follows: < img alt = \"\ud83d\ude04\" class = \"emojione\" src = \"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/emojione/2.2.7/assets/png/64/1f604.png\" title = \":smile:\" /> Generator Specific Options Option Type Default Description classes string Name of the index used Specifies the class(es) to be used in the image element. image_path string CDN for the default index used This can be either a local path or a CDN containing the assets. By default, an appropriate CDN is provided for EmojiOne, Gemoji, and Twemoji depending on which index is being used. non_standard_image_path string CDN for the default index used This can be either a local path, or a CDN containing the assets. Currently, only Gemoji's non-standard emoji take advantage of this as the GitHub CDN alters the path slightly for its non-Unicode emoji. By default, an appropriate CDN is provided for Gemoji. attributes dictionary {} A dictionary containing tag attributes as key value string pairs. The dictionary keys are the attribute names and dictionary values are the attribute values. pymdownx.emoji.to_svg This generator was written to output SVG images and supports EmojiOne and Twemoji. EmojiOne's SVG support is only for the free 2.2.7 release, so the default CDN still references the 2.2.7 release. EmojiOne short names added after 2.2.7 will not find images. You can of course reference local SVG images as well by pointing image_path to them as well. The SVG image outputs as: < img alt = \"\ud83d\ude04\" class = \"emojione\" src = \"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/emojione/assets/svg/1f604.svg\" title = \":smile:\" /> Generator Specific Options Option Type Default Description classes string Name of the index used Specifies the class(es) to be used in the image element. The default will match the name of the index used. image_path string A CDN for EmojiOne images This can be either a local path or a CDN containing the assets. By default, an appropriate CDN is provided for EmojiOne. attributes dictionary {} A dictionary containing tag attributes as key value string pairs. The dictionary keys are the attribute names and dictionary values are the attribute values. pymdownx.emoji.to_png_sprite This generator was written to support PNG sprite output for EmojiOne. It is expected that this will be used in conjunction with the the official EmojiOne CSS. You can include the CSS from the CDN in your document. The CSS comes in three sizes: 32, 64, 128. Make sure to set the correct size in the options to generate the appropriate classes. Example CDN for the 2.2.7 version with 64px PNGs: https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/emojione/2.2.7/assets/sprites/emojione.sprites.css . to_png_sprite outputs the emoji as a span in the form below. The CSS will apply the appropriate mapping in the sprite PNG to the background image of the span. < span class = \"emojione-64-people _1f604\" title = \":smile:\" > \ud83d\ude04 </ span > Generator Specific Options Option Type Default Description classes string Name of the index used Class(es) used for the span where the classes are inserted as \"class\" in the following template: ' %(class)s - %(size)s - %(category)s _ %(unicode)s ' . size int 64 Integer specifying the size for the class above. attributes dictionary {} A dictionary containing tag attributes as key value string pairs. The dictionary keys are the attribute names and dictionary values are the attribute values. pymdownx.emoji.to_svg_sprite This was written to support EmojiOne SVG sprite output. The output form was taken directly from an example in the EmojiOne source. It is expected that the the user will provide a local version of the official SVG sprite and the path to it. Unfortunately there is no free 3.0 SVG sprite, so you will need to download the old 2.27 one. The output is: < svg class = \"emojione\" >< description > \ud83d\ude04 </ description >< use xlink:href = \"./../assets/sprites/emojione.sprites.svg#emoji-1f604\" ></ use ></ svg > Generator Specific Options Option Type Default Description classes string Name of the index used Class(es) to apply to the svg element where the classes are inserted as \"class\" in the following template: ' %(class)s - %(unicode)s ' . image_path string '' Path to the SVG sprites. pymdownx.emoji.to_alt This generator supports all emoji indexes. The generator outputs the alt value directly to the document. The output can be Unicode characters, HTML entities, or even just the short name depending on what the global setting of alt is set to. \ud83d\ude03 There are no generator specific options. Custom Emoji Indexes def emoji_index ( options , md ) In order to provide a custom index, the Emoji extension must be given a function that returns a suitable emoji index. The function should simply return the custom index. It accepts both on options dictionary and the markdown object. The options object is the same object that is specified in in the extensions settings . The index should be returned in the following format: emoji_index = { # Name is the name of the index. This is passed into the emoji # generator functions and can be used to differentiate logic # for different indexes if required. \"name\" : \"myindex\" , # The actual index. A dictionary of all the emoji. # Different emoji short names with the same Unicode data # can be mentioned under aliases. \"emoji\" : { # Key is the short name. \":zero:\" : { # Name is the long name. \"name\" : \"keycap digit zero\" , # Category of emoji. # Not needed if this is a non-Unicode, custom # emoji with no category \"category\" : \"symbol\" , # Unicode is the representation of the Unicode # code points, but it is not necessarily valid Unicode # code points. Essentially it is what represents the Unicode # and is used as the image name for pngs and svgs. Depending # on the index, it may not be code points alt all. It is also # sometimes used as part of special class names in the HTML # output (depending on the generator). # # In the case of Gemoji and EmojiOne this is the Unicode code # points with variations and joiners striped out. In the case of # Twemoji, it is usually full valid code points though leading # zeros are stripped from the beginning. # # Do not include this if the emoji is a custom, non-Unicode emoji. \"unicode\" : \"0030-20e3\" , # This is the full Unicode code points and is # used for the \"alt\" attributes in the HTML output of images. # It is redundant to include this if it is the # same as 'unicode', but it won't hurt anything if it is. # # Do not include this if the emoji is a custom, # non-Unicode emoji. This shows a fully qualified emoji code, # but it could just as easily be \"0030-2033\" which is also valid. # Some indexes will provide fully qualified, some may not. \"unicode_alt\" : \"0030-fe0f-20e3\" }, # No need to specify 'unicode_alt' as it is the same # as 'unicode'. \":thumbsup:\" : { \"name\" : \"thumbs up sign\" , \"unicode\" : \"1f44d\" , \"category\" : \"people\" }, # Should not specify any unicode fields # as this is not a real unicode emoji. \":octocat:\" : { \"name\" : \"octocat\" }, }, # Short names that share previously defined Unicode data # like '+1' and 'thumbsup' etc. \"aliases\" : { # Key is the alias. # Value is the short name it maps to in the # previously defined 'emoji' key. \":+1:\" : \":thumbsup:\" } } New 7.1 Emoji indexes now accept options and md . The old sans argument format will still be accepted, but in the future the arguments will be expected. Custom Emoji Generators def emoji_generator ( index , shortname , alias , uc , alt , title , category , options , md ) Each different kind of output is controlled by a different emoji generator function, but all generator functions have the same input format. The options object is the same object that is specified in in the extensions settings and is shared with the index as well. Parameter Type Description index string The name of the selected emoji index. shortname string The current short name. This may differ from the actual name used in a document as aliases get translated to the main short name. alias string If the specified short name is an alias, that alias will be set here, and the main short name will be found under shortname . This will be None if the name used was not an alias. uc string This is a string representation of the Unicode, it could technically be anything as this is normally used to reference image files. So while some indexes will have this be code points, it may not contain code points at all or it may strip out code points for simpler image names. So the value here will not always be practical for calculating the actual Unicode points of an emoji. This will be None for non-standard emoji that are not Unicode. alt string This is the alternative emoji value (or fallback value). Its format will differ depending on the extension setting alt and also the index being used. This will be returned as either the full valid Unicode characters or HTML entities, or it will be the short name used. See the alt setting for more info. title string This is the title that can be used in image elements. Depending on the global extension setting title , this will either return the full long description, the short name, or None . See the title setting for more info. category string Category of the emoji, or None if there is no category for the emoji. options dictionary This is a dictionary to specify generator and index function specific options. This can be anything, and it is up to the generator function and the index function to parse relevant options and provide defaults. md class This is the Markdown class object. This is mainly used to access specific things needed from the Markdown class when formatting your output. If you needed to stash your output, you would do something like: md . htmlStash . store ( alt , safe = True ) . Non-Unicode emoji Keep in mind that Gemoji ships with some non-standard emoji like :octocat: that do not have Unicode code points. uc and alt are affected by this and will return None and the short name respectively instead of strings describing the Unicode points. For example :octocat: will just return None for uc and :octocat: for alt . If you are parsing an index with custom emoji, like Gemoji has, then you need to be aware of this. Using with MkDocs This project uses these extensions with MkDocs to generate the documentation. It might not be obvious how to set the index or generator functions in MkDocs' YAML settings file, but it is actually pretty easy. The functions are referenced like you would import them in Python except you also append them with a special prefix to let the YAML module know that the setting value is a Python object. For instance, to specify the to_svg generator, you would simply reference it like this: !!python/name:pymdownx.emoji.to_svg (or you could use your own custom module ). markdown_extensions : - pymdownx.emoji : emoji_generator : !!python/name:pymdownx.emoji.to_svg Emoji Index Updates The Emoji extension might at times be behind on having indexes built from the latest repositories. We try to keep the indexes updated with new releases, but if they fall out of date, you can open an issue on the this project's issue page to alert the maintainer(s) and they will update them when someone gets a chance. Pull requests are also welcome. The process for updating the indexes is automated, so it is fairly easy to do a pull request. See Generating Emoji Indexes for more info. Options Option Type Default Description emoji_index function emojione index A function that returns the index to use when parsing :short_name: syntax. See Default Emoji Indexes to see the provided indexes. emoji_generator function to_png generator A function that takes the emoji info and constructs the desired emoji output. See Default Emoji Generators to see the provided generators. title string 'short' Specifies the title format that is fed into the emoji generator function. Can either be long which is the long description of the emoji, short which is the short name ( :short: ), or none which will simply pass None . alt string 'unicode' Specifies the format for the alt value that is passed to the emoji generator function. If alt is set to short , the short name will be passed to the generator. If alt is set to unicode the Unicode characters are passed to the generator. Lastly, if alt is set to html_entity , the Unicode characters are passed encoded as HTML entities. remove_variation_selector bool False Specifies whether variation selectors should be removed from Unicode alt. Currently, only fe0f is removed as it is the only one presently found in the current emoji sets. options dictionary {} Options that are specific to emoji generator functions. Supported parameters can vary from function to function. New 7.1 options is now shared between index and generator functions opposed to being passed to the generator function only. The generator and/or index function should decide which of the arguments are relevant for its usage and parse accordingly. Legacy GitHubEmoji Emulation The Emoji extension was actually created to replace the now retired GitHubEmoji extension. Emoji was written to be much more flexible. If you have a desire to configure the output to be like the legacy GitHubEmoji extension, you can use the settings below. This shows the full setup.

Their free emoji set includes PNGs in sizes of 32x32, 64x64, and 128x128 which are all available via a CDN. The older EmojiOne (version 2.2.7), is what is used by default.

The options object is the same object that is specified in in the extensions settings and is shared with the index as well. Parameter Type Description index string The name of the selected emoji index. shortname string The current short name. This may differ from the actual name used in a document as aliases get translated to the main short name. alias string If the specified short name is an alias, that alias will be set here, and the main short name will be found under shortname . This will be None if the name used was not an alias. uc string This is a string representation of the Unicode, it could technically be anything as this is normally used to reference image files. So while some indexes will have this be code points, it may not contain code points at all or it may strip out code points for simpler image names. So the value here will not always be practical for calculating the actual Unicode points of an emoji. This will be None for non-standard emoji that are not Unicode. alt string This is the alternative emoji value (or fallback value). Its format will differ depending on the extension setting alt and also the index being used. This will be returned as either the full valid Unicode characters or HTML entities, or it will be the short name used. See the alt setting for more info. title string This is the title that can be used in image elements. Depending on the global extension setting title , this will either return the full long description, the short name, or None . See the title setting for more info. category string Category of the emoji, or None if there is no category for the emoji. options dictionary This is a dictionary to specify generator and index function specific options. This can be anything, and it is up to the generator function and the index function to parse relevant options and provide defaults. md class This is the Markdown class object. This is mainly used to access specific things needed from the Markdown class when formatting your output. If you needed to stash your output, you would do something like: md . htmlStash . store ( alt , safe = True ) . Non-Unicode emoji Keep in mind that Gemoji ships with some non-standard emoji like :octocat: that do not have Unicode code points. uc and alt are affected by this and will return None and the short name respectively instead of strings describing the Unicode points. For example :octocat: will just return None for uc and :octocat: for alt .

Its purpose is to provide a single place to configure syntax highlighting for code blocks. Both InlineHilite and SuperFences can use Highlight to configure their highlight settings, but Highlight will also run all non-fence code blocks through the highlighter as well. The Highlight extension is inspired by CodeHilite , but differs in features. PyMdown Extensions chooses not to implement special language headers for standard Markdown code blocks like CodeHilite does; PyMdown Extensions takes the position that language headers are better suited in fenced code blocks. So standard Markdown code blocks will just be styled as plain text unless guess_language is enabled. If you wish to highlight lines and define line numbers per code block, it is advised to use the SuperFences extension. The Highlight extension can be included in Python Markdown by using the following: import markdown md = markdown . Markdown ( extensions = [ 'pymdownx.highlight' ]) Syntax Highlighting If Pygments is installed, it will be the default syntax highlighter, but if it is not, or if use_pygments is turned off, code tags will be rendered in the HTML5 format for JavaScript highlighting: < pre class = \"highlight\" >< code class = \"language-mylanguage\" ></ code ></ pre > highlight is the default class name, and will be applied to code blocks, whether Pygments is disabled or not. This class name can be changed with the css_class option. By default, the prefix language- is applied to language classes when Pygments is disabled or when Pygments code blocks enable language classes via pygments_lang_class . This prefix can be changed via the language_prefix option. The language class, and any attributes added via the attr_list extension, are added to the < code > element. The code_attr_on_pre option will force them to be attached to the < pre > element. All other options specifically control the Pygments highlighter and will have no affect if Pygments usage is disabled. Extended Pygments Lexer Options If using Pygments, some lexers have special settings. For instance, the php lexer has the option startinline which, if enabled, will parse PHP syntax without requiring <? at the beginning. Highlight allows you to configure these settings via the option extend_pygments_lang . extend_pygments_lang allows you to create a special Pygments alias language where you can configure the language settings to your liking. So if you wanted to enable startinline for php , you might create a language alias called php-inline that maps to php with startinline enabled. This would allow you to use php for normal PHP blocks, but also allow you to do use php-inline for code without specifying <? . You can also use extend_pygments_lang to completely override the base language's options \u2013 assuming your specified name overrides an existing name. extend_pygments_lang is an array of dictionaries. Each dictionary contains three keys: name which is the new name you are adding, lang which is the language the new name maps to, and options which is a dictionary of the options you wish to apply. Highlight Example To create the above mentioned php-inline , this example illustrates the configuration, and Markdown syntax you would use. Output Markdown Config $a = array ( \"foo\" => 0 , \"bar\" => 1 ); `#!php-inline $a = array(\"foo\" => 0, \"bar\" => 1);` extend_pygments_lang = [ { \"name\" : \"php-inline\" , \"lang\" : \"php\" , \"options\" : { \"startinline\" : True }} ] New 9.2 pygments_lang_class added in 9.2. Line Number Styles Pygments has two available styles when outputting source code with line numbers enabled: table and inline . table is the default output and creates a table output for lines with numbers. inline places the line numbers directly in the source code output and can sometimes be undesirable as copy and paste will always copy the line numbers as well. The Highlight extension provides a third line number style called pymdownx-inline . Instead of writing line numbers directly in the pre like Pygments' default inline style does, it writes the line numbers as < span class = \"lineno\" data-linenos = \"1 \" ></ span > . This way the line numbers are un-selectable and can be displayed with CSS: [ data-linenos ] : before { content : attr ( data -linenos ); } Line number styles are set with the option linenums_style as described in Options . Options All options below control the Pygments' output. The two exceptions are use_pygments which disables Pygments, css_class which sets the name of the class assigned to the generated code blocks, and code_attr_on_pre which only apply when Pygments is disabled.

See Extended Pygments Lexer Options for more info. language_prefix string 'language-' Controls the prefix applied to the language class when Pygments is not used. By default, uses the HTML5 prefix of language- . code_attr_on_pre bool False By default, the language class and all attributes added via the attr_list extension are attached to the < code > element. This forces them to be attached to the < pre > element. auto_title bool False When using Pygments, for all code blocks generate a title header with the name of the lexer being used. The lexer name is pulled directly from Pygments and title cased appropriately. auto_title_map dict {} A dictionary used to override certain titles returned by auto_title . Simply specify the title to override as the key and the desired title as the value. line_spans string '' Controls the Pygments option of a similar name. If set to a nonempty string, e.g. foo , the formatter will wrap each output line in a < span > tag with an id of foo-<code_block_number>-<line_number> . anchor_linenums bool False Enables the Pygments option of a similar name.

See Extended Pygments Lexer Options for more info. language_prefix string 'language-' Controls the prefix applied to the language class when Pygments is not used. By default, uses the HTML5 prefix of language- . code_attr_on_pre bool False By default, the language class and all attributes added via the attr_list extension are attached to the < code > element. This forces them to be attached to the < pre > element. auto_title bool False When using Pygments, for all code blocks generate a title header with the name of the lexer being used. The lexer name is pulled directly from Pygments and title cased appropriately. auto_title_map dict {} A dictionary used to override certain titles returned by auto_title . Simply specify the title to override as the key and the desired title as the value. line_spans string '' Controls the Pygments option of a similar name. If set to a nonempty string, e.g. foo , the formatter will wrap each output line in a < span > tag with an id of foo-<code_block_number>-<line_number> . anchor_linenums bool False Enables the Pygments option of a similar name. If set to True , will wrap line numbers in < a > tags. Used in combination with linenums and line_anchors . If line_anchors is not configured, __codelineno will be assumed as the ID prefix. line_anchors bool False Controls the Pygments option of a similar name. If set to a nonempty string, e.g. foo , the formatter will insert an anchor tag with an id (and name) of foo-<code_block_number>-<line_number> . pygments_lang_class bool False If set to True, the language name used will be included as a class attached to the element with the associated language_prefix . New 7.1 linenums_class was added in 7.1 . New 7.2 linenums now accepts None as the default for allow line numbers to be enabled per code block.

Borrowing from CodeHilite's existing syntax, InlineHilite utilizes the following syntax to insert inline highlighted code: `:::language mycode` or `#!language mycode` . In CodeHilite, #! means \"use line numbers\", but line numbers will never be used in inline code regardless of which form is used. Use of one form or the other is purely for personal preference. As this feature is discussed further, we will call these specifiers ( #! and ::: ) mock shebangs, mainly due to the first options similar syntax to a real shebang. Inline Highlighted Code Example Output Markdown Here is some code: import pymdownx ; pymdownx . __version__ The mock shebang will be treated like text here: #!js var test = 0; . Here is some code: `#!py3 import pymdownx; pymdownx.__version__`. The mock shebang will be treated like text here: ` #!js var test = 0; `. When using the colon mock shebang, 3 or more colons can be used. Mock shebangs must come immediately after the opening backtick(s) and must be followed by at least one space. If you need to escape a mock shebang, at the start of a code block, just put a space before it, and it will be treated as part of the code. The InlineHilite extension can be included in Python Markdown by using the following: import markdown md = markdown . Markdown ( extensions = [ 'pymdownx.inlinehilite' ]) Code Highlighting Assuming Pygments is installed, code highlighting will be handled by Pygments . If Pygments is not installed, or disabled, code blocks will be output for JavaScript syntax highlighters as: < code class = \"highlight language-mylanguage\" ></ code > Highlighting can be further controlled via the pymdownx.highlight extension. Using JavaScript Highlighters If using Pygments , the elements will be highlighted without issues, but you may need to adjust CSS to get the general style of the inline block the way you like it. If you are using a JavaScript highlighter, such as highlight.js , you will most likely need to construct a JavaScript method to target the inline blocks as these may not be targeted out of the box. You may also find it useful to tag inline code with a different class than what is used for block code so you can also process and style them differently. By default, it uses whatever pymdownx.highlight uses, but this can be configured independently for inline code in the options . Custom Inline Blocks Like SuperFences , InlineHilite now provides a support for custom inline blocks. Inline Math For more indepth information on how to reproduce the example above, check out Arithmatex Documentation . Output Markdown \\(p(x|y) = \\frac{p(y|x)p(x)}{p(y)}\\) `#!math p(x|y) = \\frac{p(y|x)p(x)}{p(y)}` Custom inline code blocks are created via the custom_inline option. custom_inline takes an array of dictionaries where each dictionary defines a custom inline code block. The dictionaries requires the following keys: Keys Description name The language name that is specified when using the fence in Markdown. If given * , it will override the base inline logic, the default for all inline names not handled by other custom inlines. class The class name assigned to the HTML element when converting from Markdown to HTML. format A function that formats the HTML output. The function should return either an ElementTree object or a string as HTML. New in 7.0 Starting in 7.0, you can override the base inline logic (the syntax highlighter) by specifying the custom inline with a name of * . This means that if an inline does not match any other custom inline, the default, fallback inline would be handled by your custom * inline. This can be useful for tailoring a inline for a specific, favorite JavaScript highlighter. Formatters def custom_formatter ( source , language , css_class , md ): return el # Or string In general, formatters take four parameters: The source found between the backticks. The specified language. The class name originally defined via the class option in the custom_inline entry. The Markdown class object. It Should return a either an ElementTree element or a string as HTML. When returning a string, InlineHilite will treat the string as ready for HTML, so escape what needs to be escaped as it is expected to be fully ready HTML and will be stashed and re-inserted at post processing. When returning an ElementTree object, remember to wrap string content as markdown.util.AtomicString to prevent it from being processed further, you can also stash raw HTML string content assigned to elements like InlineHilite does by default above.

Markdown ( extensions = [ 'pymdownx.keys' ]) Special Characters Before/After Key You might have noticed that in this page many keys show special Unicode symbols before (and sometimes after) a key's text. The Keys extension only provides ASCII labels out of the box. Any special Unicode characters that are seen in this document are provided by using additional CSS. If desired, you can provide your own symbols by doing one of the following: You can use CSS styling. The elements are created with classes that are derived from the main key code name (not the aliases) so that you can target them to provide special styling. Check out Formatting for more info. You can also override the label that is output for the key by provided your own text via the key_map parameter. This would require no additional CSS. More info is provided here . Formatting By default, Keys outputs keys in the form: < span class = \"keys\" > < kbd class = \"key-ctrl\" > Ctrl </ kbd > < span > + </ span > < kbd class = \"key-alt\" > Alt </ kbd > < span > + </ span > < kbd class = \"key-delete\" > Delete </ kbd > </ span > Separator span s will be omitted if a separator is not provided via the options . Notice the wrapper span has the class keys applied to it. This is so you can target it or the elements under it with CSS. Each recognized key has its own special key class assigned to it in the form key-<key name> . These individual key classes are great if you want to show a special modifier key symbol before the key text (which is done in this documentation). The wrapper keys class can be customized with options, and the individual key classes are generated from the key-map index . separator span s will be omitted if a separator is not provided via the options ) Custom Keys If you would like to generate a key which isn't in the key index, you can extend the key map via a special option . But if you don't need a key with a special class generated, or you need a way to quickly enter a one time, arbitrary key, you can just insert it directly, instead of specifying the key's name, by quoting the content displayed instead of a key name. You can also enter HTML entities if desired.

Key-Map Index By default, Keys provides a key-map index for English US keyboards. The key-map index is a dictionary that provides all the supported key names along with their corresponding display text. There is also a separate alias dictionary which maps some aliases to entries in the key-map index. Extending/Modifying Key-Map Index If you want to add additional keys, or override text of existing keys, you can feed in your keys via the key_map option. The key_map parameter takes a simple dictionary with key names that are represented by lowercase alphanumeric characters and hyphens ( - ). The values of the dictionary represent the the text that is displayed for the key in the HTML output. So if you wanted to add a custom key, you could do this: { \"custom\" : \"Custom Key\" } . If you wanted to override the output of the option key and change it from Option to Opt , you could do this: { \"option\" : \"Opt\" } .

User's are free to reference this documentation's source to learn how. Overview MagicLink is an extension that provides a number of useful link related features. MagicLink can auto-link HTML, FTP, and email links. It can auto-convert repository links (GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket) and display them in a more concise, shorthand format. MagicLink can also be configured to directly auto-link the aforementioned shorthand format. If you happen to have some conflicts with syntax for a specific case, you can always revert to the old auto-link format as well: <https://www.link.com> . If enabled, repository link shortening will be applied to the the angle bracketed auto-link format as well. SaneHeaders It is also recommended to use SaneHeaders when using MagicLink to avoid problems when specifying a repository bug (using the syntax #1 ) at the start of a line. Python Markdown, by default, will treat #1 as a header if detected at the start of a line without SaneHeaders. The MagicLink extension can be included in Python Markdown by using the following: import markdown md = markdown . Markdown ( extensions = [ 'pymdownx.magiclink' ]) Auto-Linking MagicLink supports auto-linking HTTP, FTP and email links. You can specify these links in raw text and they should get auto-linked. There are some limitations placed on MagicLink to keep it from aggressively auto-linking text that is not part of links. If you have a link that cannot be detected, you can always use the old style angle bracketed link format: <https://www.link.com> . Auto-Linking Example Output Markdown Just paste links directly in the document like this: https://google.com . Or even an email address: fake.email@email.com . - Just paste links directly in the document like this: https://google.com. - Or even an email address: fake.email@email.com. Shorthand Links MagicLink supports shorthand references for GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket issues ( #1 ), pull/merge requests ( !13 ), GitHub Discussion ( ?1173 ), commits ( 7d1b190 ), and compares ( e2ed7e0...90b6fb8 ). You can also reference repositories ( facelessuser/pymdown-extensions ) and users ( @facelessuser ). Mentions also works for social media (only Twitter is supported at this time). The syntax used is actually very similar to GitLab's syntax. GitLab was chosen as its syntax bridges the gaps between the three providers. GitLab and Bitbucket require a pull specific syntax while GitHub does not have one. Also, while GitHub uses #<num> for issues, pulls, and discussions, the idea of using a different symbol for issue types gives us the context we need to generate the correct links for issues vs pulls, etc. Configuring To enable shorthand syntax for code repository providers and social media providers, enable repo_url_shorthand and social_url_shorthand respectively in the options . To use this feature you must first specify in the options your provider to which all shorthand references are relative to, but you will still be able to reference outside of your defaults. And if you are specifying a code repository provider as your default, you must also specify the user and repo (repository) which adds more context and allows you to shorten the syntax even more for issues relating to your default user and/or repo . This is useful if you are using MagicLink to write documentation for a project that is hosted on one of the supported code repository providers. If you are using this extension more generally, it may make more sense to set a social media provider as the default provider . There is no need to set a user or repo for a social media provider as the context is not useful for mentions. You will still be able to reference repository links with shorthand if it enabled, albeit in a longer format. Warning Links are not verified, so make sure you are specifying valid issues, repositories, and users as they will be auto-linked even if they are not valid. Mentions Mentions of other users are performed with the following syntax: @{user} . To reference a provider other than your default, use the format @{provider}:{user} Mention Example Output Markdown @facelessuser @twitter @facelessuser @twitter:twitter For code repository providers, you can also mention repositories. This feature is actually inspired by the GitHub only extension Python-Markdown/github-links , which performs similar auto-linking. The syntax to auto-link a repository with mentioning is very similar to auto-linking a user, except you append the repository to the user name like so: @{user}/{repo} . If specifying a non-default provider, the form would look like: @{provider}:{user}/{repo} . The output for repository mentions omits the @ symbol and will just show the user and repository, but you are free to style it with CSS to make it stand out more like has been done in this document. Repository Mention Example Output Markdown facelessuser/pymdown-extensions pycqa/flake8 @facelessuser/pymdown-extensions @gitlab:pycqa/flake8 Issues, Pull Requests, and Discussions Issues, pull requests, and GitHub discussions are specified with #{num} , !{num} , and ?{num} respectively. When specified in this manner, the links will assume the default repository and default user for generated links. To specify an issue for a non-default repository under the default user, prefix the repository: {repo}#{num} . To specify a repository under a non-default user, prefix both the user and repository: {user}/{repo}#{num} . Lastly, to reference an external provider, use the format {provider}:{user}/{repo}#{num} . The syntax was borrowed and adapted from GitLab as they use !{num} for pulls and #{num} for issues, ?{num} is our own take for discussions. This syntax was mainly used to ensure we could provide context to the link generator. When rendering the actual links in your documents, it will use the syntax associated with the specified provider. If this is unsatisfactory, you can override this behavior with the icons option and all links will will use the same specified convention on output regardless of the provider. Issue Example Output Markdown #1 backrefs#1 Python-Markdown/markdown#1 pycqa/flake8#385 !13 backrefs!4 Python-Markdown/markdown!598 pycqa/flake8!213 #1 backrefs#1 Python-Markdown/markdown#1 gitlab:pycqa/flake8#385 !13 backrefs!4 Python-Markdown/markdown!598 gitlab:pycqa/flake8!213 Note GitHub actually gives pull requests and issues unique values while GitLab and Bitbucket can have pulls with the same ID as an issue. So with GitHub, you can use #{num} format for both issues and pulls, and GitHub will redirect you to the appropriate issue or pull. GitLab and Bitbucket must specify pulls different from issues, hence the !13 format. Though GitHub doesn't need to use the pull format, you can if you like. This format was actually borrowed from GitLab. Commits Commit shorthand syntax is simply the 40 character commit hash value: {hash} . And much like issues and pull requests, you can denote a repository under the default user with {repo}@{hash} and a repository under a non-default user with {user}/{repo}@{hash} . Lastly, to reference an external provider, use the format {provider}:{user}/{repo}@{hash} . If the default provider is a social media provider, then only the latter syntax can be used.

This has been adopted for all the supported repository providers. Specifying a compare link is very similar to specifying a commit link except you must specify the older hash and the newer hash separated by ... : {hash1}...{hash2} . To specify a compare for a non-default repository under the default user, prefix the repository: {repo}@{hash1}...{hash2} . And to specify a compare under a non-default user, prefix both the user and repository: {user}/{repo}@{hash1}...{hash2} . Lastly, to reference an external provider, use the format {provider}:{user}/{repo}@{hash1}...{hash2} .

If we specify long form URLs from external providers, they will be shortened appropriately.

For example, https://github.com/support is not a user name, nor are any links under support repository names. By default, MagicLink has provided a list of exclusions for each provider to avoid treating such links as a user name or repository name.

Labels By default, MagicLink provides titles for the repository links in the form {provider} {label}: {info} . You can specify different values for {label} by configuring the labels option.

It was originally written for a project that wanted to preview the markdown by rendering it in a temporary location. This extension allowed the paths to be converted to work from the temporary location. This context is important when trying to understand why this extension was created. It's actual usage is limited to situations like this, so it isn't something that would get used in most normal scenarios. PathConverter takes an absolute base path. The base path is the Markdown content's assumed location at time of conversion. The path is used as a reference for locating images and referenced files relative to the Markdown content. Essentially, the references in the Markdown file would currently be relative to this base path at conversion time. The references existence is not verified, but the it is analyze to determine if it is a relative path, and if so, it is eligible for conversion. In the case of absolute mode, the relative Markdown references would be converted to absolute paths. If PathConverter is in relative mode, the extension will also need a relative path to convert to. The relative path must be an absolute path to the location the HTML is assumed to live after conversion. If the references paths can be confirmed to be relative, those references will be converted to relative paths that align to the provided relative path parameter. The idea is that a Markdown file could be found in a location that is not meant to be its final location. References within the Markdown source would link relative to the base path, but they would then be converted to be relative to it's new location \u2013 the relative path parameter.

Snippets is great for situations where you have content you need to insert into multiple documents. For instance, this document keeps all its hyperlinks in a separate file and then includes those hyperlinks at the bottom of a document via Snippets. If a link needs to be updated, it can be updated in one location instead of updating them in multiple files. Snippets is run as a preprocessor, so if a snippet is found in a fenced code block etc., it will still get processed. If when a snippet declaration is processed, and the specified file cannot be found, then the markup will be removed. If you need to show a snippet example in fenced code, please escape it as listed in Snippets Notation . Snippets can handle recursive file inclusion. And if Snippets encounters the same file in the current stack, it will avoid re-processing it in order to avoid an infinite loop (or crash on hitting max recursion depth). This is meant for simple file inclusion, it has no intention to implement features from complex template systems. If you need something more complex, you may consider using a template environment to process your files before feeding them through Python Markdown. If you are using a document generation system, this can likely be performed via a plugin for that document system (assuming a plugin environment is available). The Snippets extension can be included in Python Markdown by using the following: import markdown md = markdown . Markdown ( extensions = [ 'pymdownx.snippets' ]) Specifying Snippet Locations All snippets are specified relative to the base path(s) specified in the base_path option. base_path is a list of paths (though it will take a single string for legacy purposes). When evaluating paths, they are done in the order specified. The specified snippet will be evaluated against each base path and the first base path that yields a valid snippet will be returned. If a base path is a file, the specified snippet will be compared against the base name of that file. For instance, if we specified a snippet of test.md and we had a base_path of [ \"some/location/test.md\" ] , this would match. A specified snippet of location/test.md would not match. This is great if you have a one off file outside of your base directory, but you'd like to directly include it. Snippets Notation There are two modes of inserting snippets: single line and block. Single line mode accepts a single file name, and block accepts multiple files. Snippets does not require a specific extension, and as long as a valid file name is specified, it will attempt to process it. Single line format is done by placing the following markup for the single line notation: --8<-- \"filename.ext\" Or you can insert multiple files with block notation: --8<-- filename.md filename.log --8<-- As you can see, the notation is ASCII scissors cutting a line followed by the file name. In the case of the single line variant, the file name follows directly after the scissors and is quoted. In the case of the block format, the file names follow on separate lines and an additional scissor is added afterwards to signal the end of the block. The dashes can be as few as 2 ( --8<-- ) or longer if desired ( ---8<--------- ); whatever your preference is. The important thing is that the notation must reside on a line(s) by itself, and the path must be quoted in the case of the single line notation. If the file name is indented, the content will be indented to that level as well. To reduce confusion in block format, it is advised to ensure the entire block is indented to the same level. If you need to escape the syntax, just make sure a minimum of a space is after the quoted file name for single line format, or a space after the start or end block markers in block format. --8<-- \"escaped notation\"<space> --8<--<space> escaped notation --8<--<space> If you have a file you want to temporarily ignore, you can comment it out by prepending the path with ; (notice the semicolon is followed by a space).

Reminder Remember to read the Usage Notes for information that may be relevant when using this extension! The SuperFences extension can be included in Python Markdown by using the following: import markdown md = markdown . Markdown ( extensions = [ 'pymdownx.superfences' ]) Nested Fence Format Start and end fence boundaries are specified with either 3 or more backticks or tildes. Start and end fence boundaries must both use matching symbols (backticks or tildes) and must be of the same number of symbols. If start is 3 backticks, the fence will end with 3 backticks. Start and end fence boundaries must be aligned to the same indentation level. Content between fences must be indented at least the same amount as the start and end boundaries. Empty lines are exempted. If you are using a fenced block inside a blockquote, at the very least, the first line of the fenced block needs to have the appropriate number of > characters signifying the quote depth. > ``` a fenced block ``` Too many blank lines will cause a blockquote to terminate, so remember to use > markers accordingly if not marking every line. > ``` a fenced block > with blank lines ``` If using a fenced block as the first line of a list, you will have to leave the first line blank, but remember that the list marker must be followed by a space. -<space> ``` a fenced block ``` Definition :<space> ``` a fenced block ``` Fenced blocks should be separated from other blocks by an empty line. Paragraph. ``` a fenced block ``` Another paragraph. Injecting Classes, IDs, and Attributes You can use the brace format to specify classes and IDs. The first provided class is always used as the language class. IDs ( #id ) can also be inserted as well. Arbitrary attributes in the form key=\"value\" can be inserted as well if the attr_list extension is enabled, but when using Pygments, only key=\"value\" attributes that start with the data- prefix will be recognized, all others will be treated as options for Pygments and will be rejected if not valid. Injecting Classes HTML Markdown < table class = \"extra-class highlighttable\" >< tr >< td class = \"linenos\" >< div class = \"linenodiv\" >< pre >< span ></ span > 1 </ pre ></ div ></ td >< td class = \"code\" >< div class = \"extra-class highlight\" >< pre >< span ></ span >< code >< span cv ></ td >< td class = \"code\" >< div class = \"extra-class highlight\" >< pre >< span ></ span >< code >< span class = \"kn\" > import </ span > < spanlass =\" kn \" > import </ span > < span class = \"nn\" > hello_world </ span > \\n </ code ></ pre ></ div > \\n </ td ></ tr ></ table > ```{.python .extra-class linenums=\"1\"} import hello_world ``` When generating additional classes on a JavaScript style code block (non-Pygments code blocks), classes are injected in the code block. Non-Pygments Injecting Classes HTML Markdown < pre id = \"id\" class = \"highlight\" >< code class = \"extra-class language-python linenums\" > import hello_world </ code ></ pre > ```{.python .extra-class #id linenums=\"1\"} import hello_world ``` When using Pygments, all extra classes and attributes will be attached to the Pygments' wrapper < div > . When using a built in custom formatter , all classes and IDs are injected on to the first element < div > or < pre > . This preserves previous behavior, but you can write your own and inject them in the way that suites your needs. New 9.0 Added support for #id in Pygments brace headers. Also added support for arbitrary data- attributes if the attr_list extension is enabled. Preserve Tabs Python Markdown has an approach where it normalizes whitespace. This means \\r\\n is converted to \\n and \\t is converted to spaces. In 99% of Markdown, this is never really an issue, but with code blocks it can be. Tabs can sometimes be very useful for aligning certain kinds of data, especially when dealing with characters of varying width. Tabs in Content Output Markdown ============================================================ T Tp Sp D Dp S D7 T ------------------------------------------------------------ A F#m Bm E C#m D E7 A A# Gm Cm F Dm D# F7 A# B\u266d Gm Cm F Dm E\u266dm F7 B\u266d ``` ============================================================ T Tp Sp D Dp S D7 T ------------------------------------------------------------ A F#m Bm E C#m D E7 A A# Gm Cm F Dm D# F7 A# B\u266d Gm Cm F Dm E\u266dm F7 B\u266d ``` If you have a scenario where preserving tabs is a requirement, you can use SuperFences preserve_tabs option to prevent converting tabs to spaces inside fenced code blocks. This only applies to fenced code blocks. Indented code blocks and inline code blocks will still be treated with Python Markdown's default behavior. This feature is experimental and actually applies the fences before whitespace normalization and bypasses the normalization for the code content. Code Highlighting Assuming Pygments is installed, code highlighting will be handled by Pygments by default. If Pygments is not installed, or disabled, code blocks will be created using HTML5 style tags for a JavaScript syntax highlighter: < pre class = \"highlight\" >< code class = \"language-mylanguage\" ></ code ></ pre > . If you disable highlight_code , specified languages will be ignored, and the content will be wrapped in a simple pre and code tags with no classes. Highlighting can be further controlled via the pymdownx.highlight extension. When using fenced code blocks, you can specify a specific syntax language to highlight with by specifying the language name directly after the opening tokens (either ``` or ~~~ ). Whether using Pygments or some other JavaScript highlighter, the syntax is the same, but please consult your highlighter's documentation for recognized language syntax specifiers. Highlight Example Output Markdown import foo.bar ```py3 import foo.bar ``` Showing Line Numbers Line numbers are provided via Pygments and can either be shown per code block or globally for all. To show globally via pymdownx.highlight , you must set linenums to True in the respective extension. To set line numbers per code block, you can specify a special setting directly after the opening tokens (and language if present). Simply specify the starting line line number with option linenums=\"1\" . The setting is followed by the equal sign and the value must be quoted. Valid line numbers are n > 0. If linenums is enabled globally, this will just control the starting line shown in the block. Line Number Example Output Markdown import foo.bar ``` {linenums=\"1\"} import foo.bar ``` And, if we wanted to start with a different starting line number, we would just specify something other than 1 . Custom Line Number Start Example Output Markdown import foo.bar ``` {linenums=\"2\"} import foo.bar ``` Pygments also has a few additional options in regards to line numbers. One is \"line step\" which, if set to a number n > 1, will print only every n th line number. The other option is a setting that can mark line numbers as \"special\" with a span and class special . If the special parameter is set to a number n > 0, every n th line number is given the CSS class special . So to set showing only every other line number, we could do the following. Line options are separated by a space, and \"line step\" is always the second option, so you must specify line start before line step. Nth Line Example Output Markdown \"\"\"Some file.\"\"\" import foo.bar import boo.baz import foo.bar.baz ``` {linenums=\"1 2\"} \"\"\"Some file.\"\"\" import foo.bar import boo.baz import foo.bar.baz ``` To set every other line as special, you must set the third linenums option (specify line start and step before it). Special must be a value of n > 0. Additionally, you can set this globally with linenums_special in the Highlight extension . Special Line Example Output Markdown \"\"\"Some file.\"\"\" import foo.bar import boo.baz import foo.bar.baz ``` {linenums=\"1 1 2\"} \"\"\"Some file.\"\"\" import foo.bar import boo.baz import foo.bar.baz ``` For JavaScript libraries, a class of linenums is written to the block. This may or may not be leveraged by your chosen highlighter. It is uncertain at this time whether line number support for JavaScript highlighters will be enhanced beyond this.w what to inject. Highlighting Lines Via Pygments, certain lines can be specified for highlighting. This is done by specifying a special setting directly after the opening tokens (and language if present). The setting is named hl_lines and the value should be the targeted line numbers separated by spaces. Highlight Lines Example Output Markdown \"\"\"Some file.\"\"\" import foo.bar import boo.baz import foo.bar.baz ```{.py3 hl_lines=\"1 3\"} \"\"\"Some file.\"\"\" import foo.bar import boo.baz import foo.bar.baz ``` Line numbers are always referenced starting at 1 ignoring what the line number is labeled as when showing line numbers. Highlight Lines with Line Numbers Example Output Markdown \"\"\"Some file.\"\"\" import foo.bar import boo.baz import foo.bar.baz ```{.py3 hl_lines=\"1 3\" linenums=\"2\"} \"\"\"Some file.\"\"\" import foo.bar import boo.baz import foo.bar.baz ``` If you'd like to do a range of lines, you can use the notation x-y where x is the starting line and y is the ending line. You can do multiple ranges and even mix them with non ranges. Highlight Ranges Output Markdown import foo import boo.baz import foo.bar.baz class Foo : def __init__ ( self ): self . foo = None self . bar = None self . baz = None ```{.py3 hl_lines=\"1-2 5 7-8\"} import foo import boo.baz import foo.bar.baz class Foo: def __init__(self): self.foo = None self.bar = None self.baz = None ``` Code Block Title Headers New 9.0 Title headers are new in version 9.0 . When Pygments is enabled, a header with a title can be applied with the title option. This essentially controls the Pygments' filename option under the hood. It made more sense to use the term title as people can really set any arbitrary title, not just filenames. Pygments will simply output the HTML below. The user is responsible for provided CSS to style the header. Pygments uses the class name of filename as that is the feature being used under the hood. < div class = \"highlight\" > < span class = \"filename\" > Some Title </ span > < pre >< code ></ code ></ pre > </ div > If using line numbers and the linenums_style set to table (the default), the title will be inserted in < th > element at the start of the table set to span both the line number column and the line column. < table class = \"highlighttable\" > < tr > < th colspan = \"2\" class = \"filename\" >< div class = \"highlight\" >< span class = \"filename\" > My title </ span ></ div ></ th > </ tr > < tr > < td class = \"linenos\" >< div class = \"linenodiv\" >< pre >< span ></ span >< span class = \"normal\" > 1 </ span ></ pre ></ div ></ td > < td class = \"code\" >< div class = \"highlight\" >< pre >< code ></ code ></ pre ></ div ></ td > </ tr > </ table > Title Output Markdown My Cool Header import foo.bar import boo.baz import foo.bar.baz ```{.py3 title=\"My Cool Header\"} import foo.bar import boo.baz import foo.bar.baz ``` If the auto_title option is enabled in the Highlight extension , the title will be auto populated with the name of the lexer used to highlight the code (unless title is manually specified). In the example below, no title is specified, but the the title is extracted from the Python lexer. Auto Filename Output Markdown Python import foo.bar import boo.baz import foo.bar.baz ```python import foo.bar import boo.baz import foo.bar.baz ``` There may be some cases where a Lexer returns a result that is undesired. For example, when a user specifies the pycon lexer, the title that is returned is quite verbose. Auto Filename Output Markdown Python Console Session >>> 3 + 3 6 ```pycon >>> 3 + 3 6 ``` In a case like above, it may be desired to simply use the title Python . We can configure the Highlight extension to override any auto returned title. Simply create mapping via the auto_title_map specifying the title you wish to override as the key, and the desired title as the value. extension_configs = { \"pymdownx.highlight\" : { \"auto_title\" : True , \"auto_title_map\" : { \"Python Console Session\" : \"Python\" } } } Now whenever we use pycon , we get \"Python\" instead of \"Python Console Session\". Python >>> 3 + 3 6 Pygments Line Anchors and Spans New 9.0 The various line wrapping options are new to version 9.0 . Pygments offers a couple of options that will wrap lines, line numbers even create anchor links for line numbers. SuperFences, when using Pygments, exposes these options under similar names. In this example, we will wrap each line of code in a span. Pygments will create an ID for each span using the prefix that we provide. We simply set the global config option line_spans and specify the desired \"prefix\" ( _codeline ), and then every line will be wrapped in a span with the ID prefix-x-y where prefix is the user specified prefix, x is a unique number for the code block, and y is the line number. After that, it is up to the user to do as they with to target the ID with either JavaScript and/or CSS. Config Markdown HTML extension_configs = { \"pymdownx.highlight\" : { 'linenums_style' : 'inline' , 'line_spans' : '__codeline' } } ```{.python linenums=\"1 1\" } import foo ``` < div class = \"highlight\" > < pre > < span ></ span > < code > < span id = \"__codeline-0-1\" >< span class = \"linenos\" > 1 </ span >< span class = \"kn\" > import </ span > < span class = \"nn\" > foo </ span > </ span > </ code > </ pre > </ div > We can also wrap line numbers with with a link and inject anchors so you can click line numbers and be taken to said line. To do this, anchor_linenums must be enabled and then a prefix should be provided via line_anchors , just like line_spans , line_anchors will produce an ID in the form prefix-x-y where x is a unique number for the code block and y is the line number. If you wish to not have the line numbers clickable, and just have the anchors inserted, you can omit enabling anchor_linenums . Config Markdown HTML extension_configs = { \"pymdownx.highlight\" : { 'linenums_style' : 'inline' , 'line_spans' : '__codeline' , 'line_anchors' : '__codelineno' , 'anchor_linenums' : True } } ```{.python linenums=\"1 1\" } import foo ``` < div class = \"highlight\" > < pre > < span ></ span > < code > < span id = \"__codeline-0-1\" >< a id = \"__codelineno-0-1\" name = \"__codelineno-0-1\" ></ a >< a href = \"#__codelineno-0-1\" >< span class = \"linenos\" > 1 </ span ></ a >< span class = \"kn\" > import </ span > < span class = \"nn\" > foo </ span > </ span > </ code > </ pre > </ div > Custom Fences SuperFences allows defining custom fences for special purposes. For instance, we could create special fences for diagrams that we could later run Mermaid on. Flow Chart Example Output Markdown graph TD A[Hard] -->|Text| B(Round) B --> C{Decision} C -->|One| D[Result 1] C -->|Two| E[Result 2] ```diagram graph TD A[Hard] -->|Text| B(Round) B --> C{Decision} C -->|One| D[Result 1] C -->|Two| E[Result 2] ``` This would allow us access to all the diagrams Mermaid offers. Some Mermaid diagrams are less practical to use as they don't scale well, but many work great. In the above example, we have set up a custom fence called diagram which allows us to process special charts with Mermaid . In this case, our special fence preserves the content and sends them to a an element so that Mermaid can then find them and convert them when the document is loaded. To learn more see UML Diagram Example . Custom fences are created via the custom_fences option. custom_fences takes an array of dictionaries where each dictionary defines a custom fence. The dictionaries require the following keys: Keys Description name The language name that is specified when using the fence in Markdown. If given * , it will override the base fence logic, the default for all fence names not handled by other custom fences. class The class name assigned to the HTML element when converting from Markdown to HTML. format A function that formats the HTML output. The function should return a string as HTML. validator An optional parameter that is used to provide a function to validate custom fence parameters. Logging When a custom fence fails, the error will be swallowed up and the error will be handled gracefully. If logging is desired, custom logging should be added into the custom function. SuperFences will not provide any. New in 7.0 Starting in 7.0, you can override the base fence logic (the syntax highlighter) by specifying the custom fence with a name of * . This means that if a fence does not match any other custom fences, the default, fallback fence would be handled by your custom * fence. This can be useful for tailoring a fence output with custom parameters for a specific, favorite JavaScript highlighter. Formatters SuperFences provides two format functions by default, but you can always write your own: Format Function Description superfences.fence_code_format Places the HTML escaped content of the fence under a < pre >< code > block. superfences.fence_div_format Places the HTML escaped content of the fence under a < div > block. In general, formatters take five parameters: the source found between the fences, the specified language, the class name originally defined via the class option in the custom_fence entry, custom options, additional classes defined in brace style headers, an optional ID, any attributes defined in the brace style header, and the Markdown object (in case you want access to meta data etc.). def custom_formatter ( source , language , css_class , options , md , classes = None , id_value = '' , attrs = None , ** kwargs ): return string or def custom_formatter ( source , language , css_class , options , md , ** kwargs ): return string All formatters should return a string as HTML. YAML Configuration Format If you are attempting to configure these options in a YAML based configuration (like in MkDocs ), please see the FAQ to see how to specify function references in YAML. New 7.0 The addition of the parameters classes and id_value is new in 7.0. If injecting additional classes or ids via brace headers , only then will classes and id_value be passed in to preserve backwards compatibility with old custom formatters. Users, moving forward, should at the very least update their formatters with **kwargs to future proof their custom formatters in case additional parameters are added in the future. Changes 8.0 Formatters now take the keyword parameter attrs . Validators The validator is used to provide a function that allows the validation of inputs. Inputs are then sorted to either attrs or options . While a formatter can treat attrs and options however they like, the intention is that key value pairs assigned to attrs are assigned directly to the fenced block's element, while options are used to conditionally control logic within the formatter. If no validator is defined, the default is used which assigns all inputs to attrs . SuperFences will only pass attrs to a formatter if an attribute style header is used for a fenced block ( ``` {.lang attr=\"value\"} ) and the attr_list extension is enabled. Attribute are not supported in the form ( ```lang attr=value ) and will cause the parsing of the fenced block to abort. Custom options can be used as keys with quoted values ( key=\"value\" ), or as keys with no value ( key ). If a key is given with no value, the value will be the key value. SuperFences will parse the options in the fence and then pass them to the validator. If the validator returns true, the options will be accepted and later passed to the formatter. attrs will only be passed to the formatter if the attr_list extension is enabled. attrs will also be ignored during Pygments highlighting. Assuming a validator fails, the next validator / formatter defined will be tried. For a contrived example: if we wanted to define a custom fence named test that accepts an option opt that can only be assigned a value of A , we could define the validator below. Notice that if we get an input that matches opt , but doesn't validate with the appropriate value, we abort handling the fenced block for this validator / formatter by returning False . All other inputs are assigned as attrs which will be passed to the formatter if the attr_list extension is enabled. def custom_validator ( language , inputs , options , attrs , md ): \"\"\"Custom validator.\"\"\" okay = True for k , v in inputs . items (): if k == 'opt' : if v != \"A\" : okay = False break else : options [ k ] = v else : attrs [ k ] = v return okay Assuming validation passed, the formatter would be given the option and any attributes (though the formatter below doesn't use the attributes). def custom_format ( source , language , class_name , options , md , ** kwargs ): \"\"\"Custom format.\"\"\" return '<div class_name=\" %s %s \", data-option=\" %s \"> %s </div>' % ( language , class_name , options [ 'opt' ], html_escape ( source )) This would allow us to use the following custom fence: ```{.test opt=\"A\"} test ``` YAML Configuration Format If you are attempting to configure these options in a YAML based configuration (like in MkDocs ), please see the FAQ to see how to specify function references in YAML. Changes 8.0 validator now accepts the following variables: inputs : with all the parsed options/attributes (validator should not modify this structure). options : a dictionary to which all valid options should be assigned to. attrs : a dictionary to which all valid attributes should be assigned to. md : the Markdown object. If the attr_list extension is enabled and the brace style header is used, any key/value pairs that were assigned as attributes by the validator will be passed to the formatter 's attrs parameter. Options in the form of key= (which have no value) will are no longer be allowed. A key with no value will assume the value to be the key name. This brings consistency as options are now parsed with attr_list . If a validator fails, the next validator / formatter pair will be tired. Exception Handling In general, if an exception occurs in either a validator or a formatter, SuperFences will gracefully ignore the validator or formatter. In the case of validators, this usually means it will try the next validator in the line. In the case of a formatter, the fenced content will just be abandoned as we are already past the point of \"validating\" and will not go back to validate the use of a different formatter. Some users may want such failures to not silently go by. SuperFences exposes a special exception called SuperFencesException which, if raised, will not gracefully be handled. If SuperFencesException is raised, this will likely bubble all the way up and cause Markdown parsing to halt. SuperFencesException can be used to to raise other exceptions if desired. Here we have a contrived example. When no options are provided in this validator, we will try and access a non-existent key in the validator which will throw a KeyError . In this case, we capture the KeyError and raise it with SuperFencesException . This will display the SuperFencesException and the original KeyError when the failure occurs: def custom_validator_except ( language , inputs , options , attrs , md ): \"\"\"Custom validator.\"\"\" okay = True try : for k in inputs . keys (): if k != 'opt' : okay = False break if okay : if inputs [ 'opt' ] != \"A\" : okay = False else : options [ 'opt' ] = inputs [ 'opt' ] except KeyError as e : raise SuperFencesException from e return okay New 9.2 SuperFencesException added in 9.2 UML Diagram Example Support This example is mainly used to illustrate how custom fences work. While Mermaid is used in the example, it is the bare minimum needed to get diagrams working. Please reference Mermaid's documents for more information on configuring features. PyMdown Extensions does not offer direct support for issues you may have in using Mermaid , feel free to use their issue tracker to report problems with their library. We do provide some advanced notes on Mermaid if you are interested in learning how we use and configure it in our own documentation. This example illustrates how you can use the custom_fences option to do UML diagrams with Mermaid . The settings below show us creating a new custom fence called mermaid . The special fence is set under the custom_fences option . The mermaid fences will pass the content through the superfences.fence_div_format format function which will wrap the content in < div > blocks and attach the class mermaid to the < div > block. extension_configs = { \"pymdownx.superfences\" : { \"custom_fences\" : [ { 'name' : 'mermaid' , 'class' : 'mermaid' , 'format' : pymdownx . superfences . fence_div_format } ] } } This would allow a user to create fenced blocks with the mermaid specifier: ```mermaid ...content here ``` The format function we used in this example only escapes the content to be included in HTML. We will rely on the Mermaid JavaScript library to render our flowcharts/diagrams in the browser. Mermaid , on load, will automatically find the < div > elements with the mermaid class and render them. We can include Mermaid via its CDN. < script src = \"https://unpkg.com/mermaid@8.6.4/dist/mermaid.min.js\" ></ script > Limitations This extension suffers from some of the same quirks that the original fenced block extension suffers from. Normally Python Markdown does not parse content inside HTML tags unless they are marked with the attribute markdown='1' . But since this is run as a preprocessor, it is not aware of the HTML blocks. SuperFences is made to work with the default extensions out of the box. It will probably not work with other extensions such as Grid Tables, since that extension allows for characters to obscure the blocks like the blockquote syntax does (though this has been designed to work with blockquotes). Ideally fenced blocks need to be handled by a block parser, but there is much work to be done on Python Markdown's internal block handlers before this is possible. SuperFences works best when following the guidelines. If the guidelines are not followed, odd results may be encountered. For the reasons above, the nested fences feature really is just a workaround. But for a lot of people, this functionality is more than sufficient. Options Option Type Default Description css_class string '' Class name is applied to the wrapper element of the code. If configured, this setting will override the css_class option of Highlight.

If you disable highlight_code , specified languages will be ignored, and the content will be wrapped in a simple pre and code tags with no classes. Highlighting can be further controlled via the pymdownx.highlight extension. When using fenced code blocks, you can specify a specific syntax language to highlight with by specifying the language name directly after the opening tokens (either ``` or ~~~ ).

Simply specify the starting line line number with option linenums=\"1\" . The setting is followed by the equal sign and the value must be quoted. Valid line numbers are n > 0. If linenums is enabled globally, this will just control the starting line shown in the block. Line Number Example Output Markdown import foo.bar ``` {linenums=\"1\"} import foo.bar ``` And, if we wanted to start with a different starting line number, we would just specify something other than 1 . Custom Line Number Start Example Output Markdown import foo.bar ``` {linenums=\"2\"} import foo.bar ``` Pygments also has a few additional options in regards to line numbers. One is \"line step\" which, if set to a number n > 1, will print only every n th line number. The other option is a setting that can mark line numbers as \"special\" with a span and class special . If the special parameter is set to a number n > 0, every n th line number is given the CSS class special . So to set showing only every other line number, we could do the following. Line options are separated by a space, and \"line step\" is always the second option, so you must specify line start before line step.

They contain an < input > with an ID of __tabbed_<tab_set_number>_<tab_number> . All the < input > elements from a specific tab set will use the name __tabbed_<tab_set_number> .

The easiest way to explain this is by example. Click a tab below and see how they seem linked: Python JavaScript Python JavaScript People ask about how to get this functionality from time to time, and the answer is JavaScript. It is the only real way to get such functionality. While this can be achieved with varying degrees of intelligence \u2013 save preferences across pages for example \u2013 we've provided a very basic example of how to accomplish this below. The function, when called, will setup click events for every tab. When clicked, it will look for tabs of the same name on the page and ensure they also get selected. It works for the default style and the new alternate style . const tabSync = () => { const tabs = document . querySelectorAll ( \".tabbed-set > input\" ) for ( const tab of tabs ) { tab . addEventListener ( \"click\" , () => { const current = document . querySelector ( `label[for= ${ tab . id } ]` ) const pos = current . getBoundingClientRect (). top const labelContent = current . innerHTML const labels = document . querySelectorAll ( '.tabbed-set > label, .tabbed-alternate > .tabbed-labels > label' ) for ( const label of labels ) { if ( label . innerHTML === labelContent ) { document . querySelector ( `input[id= ${ label . getAttribute ( 'for' ) } ]` ). checked = true } } // Preserve scroll position const delta = ( current . getBoundingClientRect (). top ) - pos window . scrollBy ( 0 , delta ) }) } } Alternate Style New 9.0 Experimental Feature The original idea behind the Tabbed extension was to provide a tabbed interface in Markdown that could be driven purely by CSS. If JavaScript was disabled or unavailable, tab functionality would remain. @squidfunk (Martin Donath), the author and maintainer of the MkDocs Material theme , who originally collaborated on the first Tabbed style, approached us again with a newer style. The aim was to solve one big problem, namely that on narrower screen sizes (like mobile), tabs are broken onto separate lines, like here for example. And this is indeed a real issue with the current style. The bonuses of the current style is that it needs absolutely no JavaScript and is driven by CSS alone. It supports as many tabs as you can throw at it but the downside is that when all the tabs do not fit on a single line, they'll wrap which is not aesthetically pleasing in all themes or interfaces. So, a new style was proposed, and we once again worked to hammer out the details, and in the end, we think we have something that is better in many ways. The new style works with only CSS and does not actually need any JavaScript to be functional, but it is ideally enhanced with a little JavaScript. The reason why is that when too many tabs are on a single line, you can overflow them with CSS and make the tab container scrollable. This can provide a much more aesthetically pleasing interface, but there are two caveats though: When tabs overflow, if you want a visual indicator that there are more tabs, it requires a little JavaScript. The number of tabs is limited by how many tabs you define in the CSS. As for the first point, this seems an acceptable restraint. When JavaScript is available, you will get a nice visual indicator, but if JavaScript is ever not available, or disabled, tab functionality will still work, just without the indicators. As for the second point, this also seems acceptable as most pages will usually have some upper limit of tabs that are ever used.

You can tweak it and modify it to get it how you like it. In general, tabbed controls are wrapped in a < div > with the class tabbed-set . They contain an < input > with an ID of __tabbed_<tab_set_number>_<tab_number> . All the < input > elements from a specific tab set will use the name __tabbed_<tab_set_number> .

The easiest way to explain this is by example. Click a tab below and see how they seem linked: Python JavaScript Python JavaScript People ask about how to get this functionality from time to time, and the answer is JavaScript. It is the only real way to get such functionality. While this can be achieved with varying degrees of intelligence \u2013 save preferences across pages for example \u2013 we've provided a very basic example of how to accomplish this below. The function, when called, will setup click events for every tab. When clicked, it will look for tabs of the same name on the page and ensure they also get selected. It works for the default style and the new alternate style . const tabSync = () => { const tabs = document . querySelectorAll ( \".tabbed-set > input\" ) for ( const tab of tabs ) { tab . addEventListener ( \"click\" , () => { const current = document . querySelector ( `label[for= ${ tab . id } ]` ) const pos = current . getBoundingClientRect (). top const labelContent = current . innerHTML const labels = document . querySelectorAll ( '.tabbed-set > label, .tabbed-alternate > .tabbed-labels > label' ) for ( const label of labels ) { if ( label . innerHTML === labelContent ) { document . querySelector ( `input[id= ${ label . getAttribute ( 'for' ) } ]` ). checked = true } } // Preserve scroll position const delta = ( current . getBoundingClientRect (). top ) - pos window . scrollBy ( 0 , delta ) }) } }","title":"Linked Tabs"},{"location":"extensions/tabbed/#alternate-style","text":"New 9.0 Experimental Feature The original idea behind the Tabbed extension was to provide a tabbed interface in Markdown that could be driven purely by CSS. If JavaScript was disabled or unavailable, tab functionality would remain. @squidfunk (Martin Donath), the author and maintainer of the MkDocs Material theme , who originally collaborated on the first Tabbed style, approached us again with a newer style. The aim was to solve one big problem, namely that on narrower screen sizes (like mobile), tabs are broken onto separate lines, like here for example. And this is indeed a real issue with the current style. The bonuses of the current style is that it needs absolutely no JavaScript and is driven by CSS alone. It supports as many tabs as you can throw at it but the downside is that when all the tabs do not fit on a single line, they'll wrap which is not aesthetically pleasing in all themes or interfaces. So, a new style was proposed, and we once again worked to hammer out the details, and in the end, we think we have something that is better in many ways. The new style works with only CSS and does not actually need any JavaScript to be functional, but it is ideally enhanced with a little JavaScript. The reason why is that when too many tabs are on a single line, you can overflow them with CSS and make the tab container scrollable. This can provide a much more aesthetically pleasing interface, but there are two caveats though: When tabs overflow, if you want a visual indicator that there are more tabs, it requires a little JavaScript. The number of tabs is limited by how many tabs you define in the CSS. As for the first point, this seems an acceptable restraint. When JavaScript is available, you will get a nice visual indicator, but if JavaScript is ever not available, or disabled, tab functionality will still work, just without the indicators. As for the second point, this also seems acceptable as most pages will usually have some upper limit of tabs that are ever used. Pages can become quite cluttered when using too many tabs, and it seems reasonable that most would limit them to some practical number.

CSS Setup Basic Tasklist Custom Tasklist In order to style these we mainly remove the list type style and adjust the margins to align with normal list styles. . markdown-body . task-list-item { list-style-type : none !important ; } . markdown-body . task-list-item input [ type = \"checkbox\" ] { margin : 0 4 px 0.25 em -20 px ; vertical-align : middle ; } If custom check box icons are desired, custom styles can be used to give a unique look to the check marks. Below is a very simple CSS example that creates a light gray square with rounded corners and displays a green Unicode check mark when the control is checked. This can be adapted to use web fonts, images, etc. . markdown-body . task-list-item { list-style-type : none !important ; } . markdown-body . task-list-item input [ type = \"checkbox\" ] { margin : 0 4 px 0.25 em -20 px ; vertical-align : middle ; } . markdown-body . task-list-control { display : inline ; /* Ensure label is inline incase theme sets it to block.*/ } . markdown-body . task-list-control { position : relative ; display : inline-block ; color : #555 ; cursor : pointer ; } . markdown-body . task-list-control input [ type = \"checkbox\" ] { position : absolute ; opacity : 0 ; z-index : -1 ; /* Put the input behind the label so it doesn't overlay text */ } . markdown-body . task-list-indicator { position : absolute ; top : -8 px ; left : -18 px ; display : block ; width : 14 px ; height : 14 px ; color : #eee ; background-color : #eee ; border-radius : .25 rem ; } . markdown-body . task-list-control input [ type = \"checkbox\" ] : checked + . task-list-indicator :: before { display : block ; margin-top : -4 px ; margin-left : 2 px ; font-size : 16 px ; line-height : 1 ; content : \"\u2714\" ; color : #1EBB52 ; }","title":"Styling with CSS"},{"location":"extensions/tasklist/#options","text":"Option Type Default Description custom_checkbox bool False Generate task lists in such a way as to allow for styling the check box with CSS. clickable_checkbox bool False Enable user to interact with checkboxes.","title":"Options"},{"location":"extensions/tilde/","text":"Tilde Overview Tilde optionally adds two different features which are syntactically built around the ~ character: delete which inserts < del ></ del > tags and subscript which inserts < sub ></ sub > tags.

In SuperFences we cover custom fences and provide an example for using Mermaid diagrams . What we showed in the example is the bare minimum required to get Mermaid working. While our example was mainly meant to instruct users on how to use custom fences, it was not our intent to give an in depth explanation on how to get Mermaid setup and working in the best way possible. To be honest, Mermaid is a little buggy and required some workarounds to alleviate some if its quirks. In general, we leave setting up custom fences for the user to explore, but we do get asked occasionally how to get Mermaid working, and what we are doing, so we thought we'd share some some additional information in case there is a strong desire from any of our users to implement a robust Mermaid solution. If you'd like to see exactly what we do, you can checkout our source code, but in this example, we will show the basics. Practical Diagrams There are a few diagrams that we feel do not work well for us, and we thought it useful to share why. The main reason is that a few of the diagrams are a bit impractical to use due to sizing and scaling issues. While there may be a way to massage them to work, we have not currently invested any time in workarounds for these diagrams. Some of the less practical examples may work better if they were pre-rendered and included as an image instead. This seems to be what Mermaid does in their own documents .

Like the others in this list, it relates to sizing and scaling. For instance, if you were to view this on a mobile device, you'd likely see the key for the pie chart missing. pie title Key elements in Product X \"Calcium\" : 42.96 \"Potassium\" : 50.05 \"Magnesium\" : 10.01 \"Iron\" : 5 Configuration We do some configuration via the initialization API command to tweak the diagrams a little. This includes theming and disabling of problematic features. We include the Mermaid library normally, but use a custom loader as we wrap our diagrams in a non-standard way. In addition, our custom loader allows us to workaround some problematic issues that arise when using Mermaid's default loader. For illustrative purposes, we've provided a basic, bare minimum configuration below that we use. window . mermaidConfig = { startOnLoad : false , theme : \"default\" , flowchart : { htmlLabels : false }, er : { useMaxWidth : false }, sequence : { useMaxWidth : false , noteFontWeight : \"14px\" , actorFontSize : \"14px\" , messageFontSize : \"16px\" } } Configuration Notes We disable htmlLabels in flowcharts as we've had issues with it in the past. It may or may not be okay to enable. Your mileage may vary. If the option is available in a diagram, we disable useMaxWidth as we prefer that our diagrams do not scale within their parent element, we rather them overflow with a scrollbar. You can leave these enabled if you like. Since we render our diagrams under a custom element with a shadow DOM, to get scrollbars, we simply enable overflow : auto on the custom diagram-div element (under the host DOM, not the shadow DOM). We disable startOnLoad as we provide our own loader (for reasons we will get into later). We do a quite a bit of custom theme overrides. Most of this is done through the Mermaid configuration options: theme , themeVariables , and themeCSS . Most users would simply use one of the default themes via the theme option, so that is what we've shown above. Custom Loader While using Mermaid, we've found a couple of issues which we were able to solve by using our own custom loader. The loader contains all the logic needed to find the Mermaid diagrams, convert them, wrap them in a shadow DOM, and insert them into the current document. In order to use the loader, it should be attached to a DOMContentLoaded event to execute only after the document is loaded. We bind our logic to this event in our loader function that checks if the Mermaid library is loaded, and only if it is, we execute the payload. The issues we are working around withing Mermaid are found below: Issues Diagrams that are found in tabbed interfaces or details, where the element may be hidden on page load, don't always render at a visible size if using Mermaid's default loader. Mermaid uses IDs in their SVG diagrams, and these can sometimes cause conflicts if you happen to have IDs on your page that match one that they use. Mermaid does not always use unique IDs. This can cause some elements of a diagram to disappear if one diagram happens to have the same ID and it is hidden in a details element or a tabbed interface. We solve these issues doing a couple things in our own custom loader. Solutions Using the < body > element as a parent, we attach a surrogate element to it and render the diagram there. Once rendered, we then insert the diagram back to where the original custom fence was. This ensures it renders under a visible parent, and renders at a normal size. We wrap each diagram in a shadow DOM element. This prevents ID leakage from one diagram to another or to the host. Apart from the issues we were trying to solve, we also use a custom loader for personal aesthetics as we like to render our diagrams in < pre >< code > tags. This allows us to render the diagrams as normal code blocks in the rare case that we cannot load the Mermaid library from the specified CDN. Putting it All Together So, putting it all together, we have the HTML generated by SuperFences. In the HTML, we include the Mermaid library and provide the configuration. We also have the custom loader that is runs when the document is loaded.

While this is not necessarily true anymore, PyMdown Extensions offers a configurable slugify to help those with picker preferences. These are very simple slugify options. There are many slugify options out there, some of which are very sophisticated. Some may prefer using one of those, but if you just want something simple, this might fill that requirement. Using Slugify slugify is a simple Unicode slugify option. It takes various parameters to control how casing is performed in slugs, what kind of Unicode normalization is preferred, and whether percent encoding of Unicode is preferred. The available key word options are found below: Parameter Default Description case 'none' Control case normalization of characters. See case options below. percent_encode False Percent encode all Unicode characters after case normalization. normalize 'NFC' Unicode normalization method. For instance, NFD will strip diacritics, but NFC does not. Case options are described below: Option Description none Performs no case normalization preserving whatever case is provided. lower Performs simple lower casing on the slug which will operate on Unicode and ASCII alike. lower-ascii Performs simple lower casing on only ASCII upper case characters. fold Applies Python's case folding function on the slug. Configuration is straight forward. Simply import the slug module and configure how you desire the Toc 's extension to utilize the slugs. extension = [ 'markdown.extensions.toc' ] extension_configs = { 'markdown.extensions.toc' : { \"slugify\" : slugs . slugify ( case = \"lower\" , percent_encode = True ) } } If you are using something like MkDocs , check out our FAQ which gives guidance on how to specify configurable functions in the YAML configuration.","title":"Slugs"},{"location":"extras/slugs/#slugs","text":"","title":"Slugs"},{"location":"extras/slugs/#alternate-slugify","text":"Python Markdown's default slugify used to strip out all Unicode chars.
