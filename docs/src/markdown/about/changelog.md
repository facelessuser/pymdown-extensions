    an exception.

## 10.1

-   **NEW**: Add new `combine_header_slug` option in legacy Tabbed extension and new Block Tab extension that will
    prefix a content tab's slug with the parent header's slug. This allows for content tab slugs that are scoped to the
    header they are under.

## 10.0.1

-   **FIX**: Regression related to snippets nested deeply under specified base path.

## 10.0

-   **Break**: Snippets: snippets will restrict snippets to ensure they are under the `base_path` preventing snippets

    behavior.

## 9.11

-   **NEW**: Emoji: Update to new CDN and use Twemoji 14.1.2.
-   **NEW**: Snippets: Ignore nested snippet section syntax when including a section.

## 9.10

-   **NEW**: Blocks: Add new experimental general purpose blocks that provide a framework for creating fenced block
    containers for specialized parsing. A number of extensions utilizing general purpose blocks are included and are
    meant to be an alternative to (and maybe one day replace): Admonitions, Details, Definition Lists, and Tabbed. Also
    adds a new HTML plugin for quick wrapping of content with arbitrary HTML elements.
-   **NEW**: Highlight: When enabling line spans and/or line anchors, if a code block has an ID associated with it, line
    ids will be generated using that code ID instead of the code block count.
-   **NEW**: Snippets: Expand section syntax to allow section names with `-` and `_`.
-   **NEW**: Snippets: When `check_paths` is enabled, and a specified section is not found, raise an error.

    whitespace from every line in text) from that block of text.
-   **NEW**: MagicLink: Update GitLab links to match recent changes and to be more correct.
-   **NEW**: MagicLink: Relax required hash length when performing link shortening.

## 9.9.3

-   **FIX**: Highlight: Remove extraneous new lines from end of indented code blocks when using
    `#!py use_pygments = False`.

## 9.9.2

-   **FIX**: Snippets syntax can break in XML comments as XML comments do not allow `--`. Relax Snippets syntax such
    that `-8<-` (single `-`) are allowed.

## 9.9.1

-   **FIX**: Use a different CDN for Twemoji icons as MaxCDN is no longer available.

## 9.9

## 9.0

Please see [Migration Notes](./releases/9.0.md#9.0) for details on upgrading to 9.0.

-   **NEW**: Arithmatex: Wrap MathJax "script" format (non-preview) with a container element just like all other
    Arithmatex output formats.
-   **NEW**: Arithmatex: MathJax (non-generic) form's container element now has the `arithmatex` class added just like
    everywhere else.
-   **NEW**: Arithmatex: Add options to override HTML element container type of inline and block math.
-   **NEW**: Arithmatex: Add new formatter functions intended to replace old math fenced/inline block formatters. New
    formatter functions are configurable. All others are marked as deprecated and will be removed at some future date.
-   **NEW**: Emoji: Upgraded Twitter emoji database to support latest emoji. It is a known issue that Twitter has
    `:man_in_santa_hat:` and `:mx_claus:` backwards -- same for `:mrs_claus:` and `:woman_in_santa_hat:`. That is on
    Twitter's side, not ours.
-   **NEW**: Highlight: Add support for the Pygments option `linespans`.
-   **NEW**: Highlight: Add support for Pygments option `lineanchors`.
-   **NEW**: Highlight: Add support for Pygments option `anchorlinenos`.
-   **NEW**: Highlight: Remove `legacy_no_wrap_code` option.
-   **NEW**: Add support for generating title headers pulled from the Pygments lexer for code blocks. Feature can be
    enabled via the new `auto_title` option. If a specific name is not preferred, these names can be overridden via
    a user defined mapping called `auto_title_map`.
-   **NEW**: SuperFences: Allow setting a title, or overriding an auto title via the new `title` option in a fenced code
    header.
-   **NEW**: SuperFences: Allow adding ID and arbitrary `data-` attributes on Pygments code blocks. The latter requires
    the `attr_list` extension to be enabled.
-   **NEW**: SuperFences: Removed old deprecated option `highlight_code` which no longer did anything.
-   **NEW**: SuperFences: Remove legacy code meant to help with transitioning to new custom fence function format.
-   **NEW**: Tabbed: New alternate style that allows for a scrollable tabs if they overflow. Feature is experimental,
    see docs for more information.
-   **NEW**: Slugs: Add new configurable `slugify` function that aims to replace all other slugify methods. Deprecate
    `uslugify`, `uslugify_encoded`, `uslugify_case`, `uslugify_case_encoded`, `gfm`, and `gfm_encoded`. `slugify` takes
    parameters returning a function that performs the desired slug handling. `slugify` adds new options `case="fold"`
    for case folding and `normalize='<normalize format here>'` (uses `NFC` by default).
-   **FIX**: BetterEm: Fix some complex cases related to "smart" logic. (#1413)
-   **FIX**: EscapeAll: Fix issue where an escaped HTML entity may end up with incorrect slug and incorrect table of
    content entry.
-   **FIX**: Highlight: Fix issue that occurs when showing only nth line numbers and using `pymdownx-inline`. Lines not
    showing a line number would not render with the proper leading space.

## 8.2

-   **NEW**: Snippets: now accepts a list of base paths which will be resolved in the order they are specified.
    Compatibility is present with legacy behavior, and a single string path will still be accepted.
-   **NEW**: Snippets: allow for specifying certain snippets to auto-append to every file. Useful for appending
    abbreviations, reference links, etc.
-   **NEW**: Snippets: a snippet base path can be a full path to a file. When a base path is a full path to a file, only
    that file will be included from the specified folder. This allows for targeting a one off file outside of the normal
    snippet paths(s).
-   **NEW**: MagicLink: add GitHub Discussions support to MagicLink. Can now use `?<num>` to link discussions. Full
    discussion links will also be shortened if shortening is enabled. (#1187)
-   **NEW**: MagicLink: add new `normalize_issue_symbols` option to make issues, pull request, and discussion links all
    render with `#` instead of `#`, `!`, and `?` respectively. Input syntax is still the same. Great if you want a
    GitHub style look where all issue types are just rendered with `#`.
-   **FIX**: MagicLink: documentation will not render links with special icons added via CSS so as not to confuse users
    that may think that is part of MagicLink. While possible with CSS, MagicLink provides no CSS automatically.
-   **FIX**: Tabbed &amp; Details: Fix corner case with lists. (#1225)
-   **FIX**: Fix issue with unescaping logic in code blocks.

## 8.1.1

-   **FIX**: Ensure content immediately before Details content or Tabbed content gets preserved.

## 8.1

-   **NEW**: Drop support for Python 3.5.
-   **NEW**: Officially support Python 3.9.

    etc.).
-   **FIX**: Avoid parsing script tags in PathConverter and B64 extensions.

## 8.0.1

-   **FIX**: Fix issue with `pymdownx-inline` an Pygments 2.7+.

## 8.0

Please see [Migration Notes](./releases/8.0.md#8.0) for details on upgrading to 8.0.

-   **NEW**: Added SaneHeaders extension.
-   **NEW**: SuperFences \& InlineHilite: gracefully handle failing custom formatters and/or validators. Users should
    add their own debug code to their formatter/validator if they suspect it isn't working.
-   **NEW**: SuperFences: if a custom fence validator fails, try the next custom fence until all are exhausted.
-   **NEW**: SuperFences: no longer allow custom options in the form `key=` (no value). Only keys with values or keys
    with no value and no `=` are accepted. Keys with no value will now assume the value to be the key name.
-   **NEW**: SuperFences: if `attr_list` extension is enabled, fenced code that use brace attribute list style headers
    (` ```{lang #id .class attr=value}`) will attach arbitrary attributes that are included in the header to the code
    element.
-   **NEW**: SuperFences: when Pygments is disabled, options (such as `linenums`) included in fenced code headers no
    longer do anything. If `attr_list` is enabled, and the brace header is used, such options will be treated as HTML
    attributes. JavaScript highlighter options should be defined in the brace header form with `attr_list` enabled in
    order to generate appropriate, compatible HTML with the chosen JavaScript highlighter.
-   **NEW**: SuperFences: backwards incompatible changes where made to custom fence API. See
    [Migration Notes](./releases/8.0.md#8.0) for instructions on how to migrate to the new API. Some temporary support
    for most of the old format is in place, but is deprecated.
-   **NEW**: SuperFences: has removed legacy code tab feature. Associated `legacy_tab_classes` option has been removed.
    Please use the Tabbed extension to create general purpose tabs for code blocks or other content.
-   **NEW**: Highlight: add new option `language_prefix` which controls the prefix applied to language classes when
    Pygments is not being used.
-   **NEW**: Highlight: A new option called `code_attr_on_pre` was added to the Highlight extension and controls whether
    language classes, and any ids, attributes, and classes that are defined in fenced code attribute list style headers,
    are attached to the code element or pre element. This has effect when using Pygments.
-   **NEW**: Highlight: option `linenums` now defaults to `None` and accepts `None`, `True`, or `False`. `None` is
    disabled by default, but can be enabled per code block. `True` enables line numbers globally. `False` disables
    globally and cannot be enabled manually per code block.
-   **NEW**: ExtraRawHTML: remove extension.
-   **FIX**: Fix issues with complex emphasis combinations in BetterEm.
-   **FIX**: Details: fix corner cases related to extension and lists.
-   **FIX**: Tabbed: fix corner cases related to extension and lists.
-   **FIX**: EscapeAll: Handle HTML entities special.
-   **FIX**: SuperFences: Fix parameter unpacking bug.

## 7.1

-   **NEW**: SuperFences will now allow number ranges in `hl_lines` option. (#878)
-   **NEW**: Emoji extension now requires custom emoji indexes to take an `options` and `md` argument. The old
    non-argument format is deprecated and still accepted, but support for indexes with no arguments will be removed at a
    future time.
-   **NEW**: Highlight now allows the specifying of a custom line number class when not using Pygments.
-   **FIX**: Better Arithmatex patterns. Fix issue #888 which caused a hang due to a regular expression typo. Also
    ensure `#!tex $$..$$` and `#!tex begin{}...end{}` patterns properly don't match if the tail markers are escaped.

## 7.0

Please see [Migration Notes](./releases/7.0.md#7.0) for details on upgrading to 7.0.

-   **NEW**: MagicLink will now shorten user name and repository links when link shortening is enabled.
-   **NEW**: Added MagicLink options `social_url_shortener` and `shortener_user_exclude` were added.
-   **NEW**: UML examples are now demonstrated with Mermaid in documentation.
-   **NEW**: SuperFences, if using the attribute list format (` ``` {.lang .additional_class, linenums="1"} `) allows
    adding additional classes. IDs can be added as well, though Pygments generated code blocks do not have a mechanism
    to actually insert IDs. The first provided class will always be treated as the language class.
-   **NEW**: Custom SuperFences' formatters should now also include the keyword parameters`classes` and `id_value` to
    allow injecting classes and IDs via the now supported attribute list format. If a code block defines no additional
    IDs and classes, the old form will be used. Formatters should include `**kwargs` at the end to future proof them
    from future changes.
-   **NEW**: Deprecate the SuperFences `highight_code` option. As SuperFences syntax has language classes built right
    in, disabling the `highlight_code` option makes little sense. While `highlight_code` is still accepted, it currently
    does nothing and will be removed at some future time.
-   **NEW**: If a custom fence (SuperFences) or inline (InlineHilite) is given the name of `*`, it will override the
    default fence logic.
-   **NEW**: SuperFences and InlineHilite no longer sync settings from CodeHilite.
-   **NEW**: Add new Tabbed extension for general purpose tabbed content in Markdown.
-   **NEW**: Deprecate old SuperFences tabbed content feature. This will be removed in 8.0.
-   **NEW**: SuperFences' tabbed content classes have changed from `supferfences-tabs` and `superfences-content` to
    `tabbed-set` and `tabbed-content` respectively. Old style classes can be enabled with the `legacy_tab_classes`
    option in SuperFences. This new option will be retired with SuperFences tabbed content feature in 8.0.
-   **NEW**: Upgrade to Twemoji 12.1.5.
-   **NEW**: New key codes and key code changes in Keys extension:
      -   Added `super`, `left-super`, and `right-super` key codes as an alternative to `meta`. Aliases `lsuper` and
          `rsuper` were also added.
      -   Added the `alt-graph` key code with `altgr` alias.
      -   Added the following new aliases: `lwindows` and `rwindows` for consistency.
      -   Added new codes `left-meta` and `right-meta` for consistency with other modifiers. Aliases `lmeta` and `rmeta`
          were also added.
      -   Added `left-option`, `right-option`, `left-command`, `right-command`, `left-meta`, and `right-meta` codes for
          consistency across similar modifier keys. Additional aliases were added as well: `loption`, `roption`, `lopt`,
          `ropt`, `left-opt`, `right-opt`, `lcommand`, `rcommand`, `lcmd`, `rcmd`, `left-cmd`, `right-cmd`, `lmeta`, and
          `rmeta`.
      -   `alt` no longer uses `menu`, `lmenu`, and `rmenu` as key aliases. `context-menu` now uses the alias `menu`.
          `context-menu` will display with `Menu` now.
-   **FIX**: Numerous deprecation warnings associated with the recent release of Python Markdown 3.2.
-   **FIX**: Ensure ExtraRawHTML raises a deprecation warning.

## 6.3

-   **NEW**: `pymdownx.extrarawhtml` is now deprecated in favor of Python Markdown's `md_in_html` extension found in the
    3.2 release.
-   **NEW**: When using Pygments 2.4+, code under `pre` elements will also be wrapped in `code` blocks:
    `#!html <pre><code></code></pre>`. `legacy_no_wrap_code` option has been provided as a temporary way to get the old
    behavior during the transition period, the option will be removed in the future.
-   **NEW**: Remove deprecated `version` and `version_info`.
-   **FIX**: Allow single word hostnames in MagicLink auto-link.

## 6.2.1

-   **FIX**: Fix issue in PathConverter where Windows path conversion from relative to absolute doesn't always work in
    all browsers.

## 6.2

-   **NEW**: Upgrade Twemoji to use 12.1.3.
-   **NEW**: Downgrade and lock EmojiOne version 2.2.7. 2.2.7 is the last truly free version of EmojiOne. This is the
    safest version that users should use. EmojiOne will not be updated anymore as they are now JoyPixels and have a
    license that is not that permissible. We've reverted support for any version greater than 2.2.7 to ensure we don't
    accidentally cause a user to improperly use JoyPixels' assets.
-   **NEW**: Drop specialized `to_awesome` generator for EmojiOne.

    @JoyPixels/emoji-toolkit 5.0.4.
-   **NEW**: Upgrade EmojiOne to 4.5.0 to the last release in the 4+ series. EmojiOne was rebranded as JoyPixels, but
    while the index is licensed under MIT, the image assets are no longer as permissible as they once were. The Emoji
    extension will only reference the last release under the older more permissible license (4.5.0). The option to use
    the CDN with EmojiOne 2.7 is still available as well which used an even more permissible license.
-   **NEW**: Upgrade Gemoji to 3.0.1.
-   **NEW**: `version` and `version_info` are now accessible via the more standard form `__version__` and
    `_version_info__`. The old format, while available, is now deprecated.
-   **FIX**: Fix GitHub emoji CDN links to use their latest.
-   **FIX**: Fix issue where entities in the form `&#35;` would trigger MagicLink's shorthand for issues.
-   **FIX**: Don't install tests when installing package.

    can be achieved by providing a span with class `MathJax_Preview` that gets auto hidden when the math is rendered.
    `insert_as_script`, `tex_inline_wrap`, and `tex_block_wrap` have all been deprecated as they are now entirely
    unnecessary. A new option has been added called `preview` that controls whether the script output generates a
