# Advanced Mermaid Notes

## Overview

!!! warning "Support"

    This is provided to help users get Mermaid running, but we do not officially offer technical support for Mermaid.
    Any issues encounter will require the user to debug it themselves.

    There may or may not be issues using an older or newer version of Mermaid than what we have documented here. We may
    not be always be up to date with the latest and greatest Mermaid version.

    We would be happy to accept pull requests that offer to improve things here or to correct misinformation.

In [SuperFences](../extensions/superfences.md) we cover [custom fences](../extensions/superfences.md#custom-fences)
and provide an example for using [Mermaid diagrams](../extensions/superfences.md#uml-diagram-example). What we showed in
the example is the bare minimum required to get Mermaid working. While our example was mainly meant to instruct users on
how to use custom fences, it was not our intent to give an in depth explanation on how to get Mermaid setup and working
in the best way possible. To be honest, Mermaid is a little buggy and required some workarounds to alleviate some if its
quirks.

In general, we leave setting up custom fences for the user to explore, but we do get asked occasionally how to get
Mermaid working, and what we are doing, so we thought we'd share some some additional information in case there is a
strong desire from any of our users to implement a robust Mermaid solution.

If you'd like to see exactly what we do, you can checkout our source code, but in this example, we will show the basics.

## Practical Diagrams

There are a few diagrams that we feel do not work well for us, and we thought it useful to share why. The main reason is
that a few of the diagrams are a bit impractical to use due to sizing and scaling issues. While there may be a way to
massage them to work, we have not currently invested any time in workarounds for these diagrams.

Some of the less practical examples may work better if they were pre-rendered and included as an image instead. This
seems to be what Mermaid does in their own [documents][mermaid].

              Sit down: 5: Me
        ```

!!! failure "Impractical"

    === "Gantt"

        Gantt charts usually are too big to render properly in a page. If the element is big enough to hold it, and the
        chart is large, they render too small to see. If the element is not wide enough, the chart can sometimes render
        squished and hard to read.

        ```diagram
        gantt
            dateFormat  YYYY-MM-DD
            title Adding GANTT diagram to mermaid
            excludes weekdays 2014-01-10

            section A section
            Completed task            :done,    des1, 2014-01-06,2014-01-08
            Active task               :active,  des2, 2014-01-09, 3d
            Future task               :         des3, after des2, 5d
            Future task2               :         des4, after des3, 5d
        ```

    === "Pie"

        Pie at times can seem to work great, but other times it can be hard to read or missing labels all together.
        Like the others in this list, it relates to sizing and scaling. For instance, if you were to view this on a
        mobile device, you'd likely see the key for the pie chart missing.

        ```diagram
        pie
            title Key elements in Product X
            "Calcium" : 42.96
            "Potassium" : 50.05
            "Magnesium" : 10.01
            "Iron" :  5
        ```

## Configuration

We do some configuration via the initialization API command to tweak the diagrams a little. This includes theming and
disabling of problematic features.

We include the Mermaid library normally, but use a custom loader as we wrap our diagrams in a non-standard way. In
addition, our custom loader allows us to workaround some problematic issues that arise when using Mermaid's default
loader.

For illustrative purposes, we've provided a basic, bare minimum configuration below that we use.

```js
window.mermaidConfig = {
  startOnLoad: false,
  theme: "default",
  flowchart: {
    htmlLabels: false,
    useMaxWidth: false
  },
  er: {
    useMaxWidth: false
  },
  sequence: {
    useMaxWidth: false,
    noteFontWeight: "14px",
    actorFontSize: "14px",
    messageFontSize: "16px"
  },
  journey: {
    useMaxWidth: false
  },
  gitGraph: {
    useMaxWidth: false
  }
}
```

!!! note "Configuration Notes"

    1. We disable `htmlLabels` in flowcharts as we've had issues with it in the past. It may or may not be okay to
       enable. Your mileage may vary.

    2. If the option is available in a diagram, we disable `useMaxWidth` as we prefer that our diagrams do not scale
       within their parent element, we rather them overflow with a scrollbar. You can leave these enabled if you like.
       Since we render our diagrams under a custom element with a shadow DOM, to get scrollbars, we simply enable
       `#!css overflow: auto` on the custom `diagram-div` element (under the host DOM, not the shadow DOM).

    3. We disable `startOnLoad` as we provide our own loader (for reasons we will get into later).

    4. We do a quite a bit of custom theme overrides. Most of this is done through the Mermaid configuration options:
       `theme`, `themeVariables`, and `themeCSS`. Most users would simply use one of the default themes via the `theme`
       option, so that is what we've shown above.

## Custom Loader

While using Mermaid, we've found a couple of issues which we were able to solve by using our own custom loader. The
loader contains all the logic needed to find the Mermaid diagrams, convert them, wrap them in a shadow DOM, and insert
them into the current document.

In order to use the loader, it should be attached to a `DOMContentLoaded` event to execute only after the document is
loaded. We bind our logic to this event in our loader function that checks if the Mermaid library is loaded, and only if
it is, we execute the payload.

The issues we are working around withing Mermaid are found below:

!!! bug "Issues"

    1. Diagrams that are found in tabbed interfaces or details, where the element may be hidden on page load, don't
       always render at a visible size if using Mermaid's default loader.

    2. Mermaid uses IDs in their SVG diagrams, and these can sometimes cause conflicts if you happen to have IDs on your
       page that match one that they use.

    3. Mermaid does not always use unique IDs. This can cause some elements of a diagram to disappear if one diagram
       happens to have the same ID and it is hidden in a details element or a tabbed interface.

We solve these issues doing a couple things in our own custom loader.

!!! success "Solutions"

    1. Using the `#!html <body>` element as a parent, we attach a surrogate element to it and render the diagram there.
       Once rendered, we then insert the diagram back to where the original custom fence was. This ensures it renders
       under a visible parent, and renders at a normal size.

    2. We wrap each diagram in a shadow DOM element. This prevents ID leakage from one diagram to another or to the
       host.

Apart from the issues we were trying to solve, we also use a custom loader for personal aesthetics as we like to render
our diagrams in `#!html <pre><code>` tags. This allows us to render the diagrams as normal code blocks in the rare case
that we cannot load the Mermaid library from the specified CDN.

## Putting it All Together

So, putting it all together, we have the HTML generated by SuperFences. In the HTML, we include the Mermaid library
and provide the configuration. We also have the custom loader that is runs when the document is loaded.

=== "Preview"
    ![Mermaid example](../images/mermaid-diagram.png)

=== "HTML"
    ```html
    <!-- Pre/code generated by SuperFences -->

        a1--&gt;a2
        end
        subgraph two
        b1--&gt;b2
        end
        subgraph three
        c1--&gt;c2
        end</code></pre>

    <script src="https://unpkg.com/mermaid@9.1.7/dist/mermaid.min.js"></script>

      er: {
        useMaxWidth: false
      },
      sequence: {
        useMaxWidth: false,
        noteFontWeight: "14px",

!!! tip "Live Example"
    For a live, working example, check out the CodePen [here](https://codepen.io/facelessuser/pen/oNeNydQ).

## Using in MkDocs

If you are using MkDocs, you would probably include your config, mermaid library, and then your loader:

```yaml
markdown_extensions:
  - pymdownx.superfences:
      preserve_tabs: true
      custom_fences:
        # Mermaid diagrams
        - name: mermaid
          class: mermaid
          format: !!python/name:pymdownx.superfences.fence_code_format

extra_javascript:
  - optionalConfig.js
  - https://unpkg.com/mermaid@9.1.7/dist/mermaid.min.js
  - extra-loader.js
```

Then in your documents, do something like this:

````
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Hard] -->|Text| B(Round)
    B --> C{Decision}
    C -->|One| D[Result 1]
    C -->|Two| E[Result 2]
```
````

To get something like this directly embedded in your documents:

```diagram
graph TD
    A[Hard] -->|Text| B(Round)
    B --> C{Decision}
    C -->|One| D[Result 1]
    C -->|Two| E[Result 2]
```
