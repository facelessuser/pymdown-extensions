# Tab

/// danger | Using `pymdownx.blocks.tab` with `pymdownx.tabbed`
The new `pymdownx.blocks.tab` extension is meant to replace `pymdownx.tabbed`, they are not meant to be used together.
Their output is identical making it easy to transition by simply swapping out the syntax, but using them both together
can cause issues as they both generate the same output and confuse each other.

If you are switching from `pymdownx.tabbed` to `pymdownx.blocks.tab`, ensure you disable `pymdownx.tabbed` to avoid
issues.

## Overview

Tab blocks are aimed at replacing the [Tabbed extension](../../tabbed.md). They function identical to Tabbed in every
way, even using the same classes, except they use the new generic block syntax.

By default, the meta-plugin is registered when `pymdownx.blocks` is registered, but if you were customizing which
meta-plugins get loaded, you can do so by doing the following:

```py3
import markdown
md = markdown.Markdown(extensions=['pymdownx.blocks.tab'])
```

## Usage

A tab can be defined using the generic block syntax and the name `tab`. Tabs should also specify the tab title in the
header. Consecutive tabs will automatically be grouped.

```text title="Tabs"
/// tab | Tab 1 title
Tab 1 content
///

/// tab | Tab 2 title
Tab 2 content
///
```

/// html | div.result

//// tab | Tab 1 title
Tab 1 content
////

//// tab | Tab 2 title
Tab 2 content
////
///

If you want to have two tab containers right after each other, you specify a hard break that will force the specified
tab to start a brand new tab container.

```text title="New Tab Group"
/// tab | Tab A title
Tab A content
///

/// tab | Tab B title
Tab B content
///

/// tab | Tab C Title
    new: true

Will be part of a separate, new tab group.
///
```

/// html | div.result

//// tab | Tab A title
Tab A content
////

//// tab | Tab B title
Tab B content
////

//// tab | Tab C title
    new: true
Will be part of a separate, new tab group.
////
///

If desired, you can specify a tab to be selected by default with the `select` option.

```
/// tab | Tab 1 title
Tab 1 content
///

/// tab | Tab 2 title
    select: True

Tab 2 should be selected by default.
///
```

As with all block plugins, you can always add new classes IDs or other attributes via the `attributes` option.

```
/// tab | Some title
    attrs: {class: class-name: id: id-name}

Some content
///
```

## Tab IDs

By default, tabs generate IDs for each tab using the following template `__tabbed_<tab_set_number>_<tab_number>`. If it
is desired to implement jumping to a specific tab with more intuitive IDs, it may be preferable to generate IDs from
slugs. To do so, two [options](#global-options) are provided: `slugify` and `separator`.

/// tip
Jumping to tabs via IDs may require additional JavaScript to select the targeted tabs.
///

If `slugify` is given a slug function (you can use any that [ship with Pymdownx Extensions](../../../extras/slugs.md)),
the Tabbed extension will generate IDs from the tab titles just like headers. `separator` allows for the specifying of
the word separator (`-` is the default).

If you'd like the slugs to be prefixed with the slug of the parent header, you can enable the `combine_header_slug`
option. If you had the following example, normally the header slug would be `header` and the content tab would have the
slug `tab`.

```
# header

/// tab | tab
content
///
```

With `combine_header_slug` enabled, the header slug would still be `header`, but now the content tab slug would be
`header-tab`.

/// new | New 10.1
`combine_header_slug` is new in 10.1
///
