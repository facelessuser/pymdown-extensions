# BetterEm

## Overview

BetterEm is an extension that aims to improve emphasis (bold and italic) handling.  It provides two modes that control
both asterisk's and underscore's bold and italic syntax: **smart** when `smart_enable` is turned on and **normal** if
`smart_enable` is turned off.  BetterEm overrides all the current bold and italic rules in Python Markdown with its own.
When **smart** is enabled for either asterisks and/or underscores, it is enabled for all variants: single and double.
When **smart** is enabled, the behavior will be very similar in feel to GFM bold and italic (but not necessarily exact).

The BetterEm extension can be included in Python Markdown by using the following:

```py3
import markdown
md = markdown.Markdown(extensions=['pymdownx.betterem'])
```

/// danger | Reminder
Remember to read the [Usage Notes](../usage_notes.md) for information that may be relevant when using this
extension!
///

## Rules

/// note | Note
For all examples on this page, underscores are __smart__ and asterisks are not.
///

BetterEm requires that non-whitespace characters follow the opening token(s) and precede the closing token(s).

```text title="Whitespace"
This * won't emphasize *

This *will emphasize*
```

/// html | div.result
This * won't emphasize *

This *will emphasize*
///

BetterEm allows for a more natural nested token feel.

```text title="Nested Token"
***I'm italic and bold* I am just bold.**

***I'm bold and italic!** I am just italic.*
```

/// html | div.result
***I'm italic and bold* I am just bold.**

***I'm bold and italic!** I am just italic.*
///

BetterEm will try to prioritize the more sane option when nesting bold (`**`) between italic (`*`).

```text title="Prioritize Best"
*I'm italic. **I'm bold and italic.** I'm also just italic.*
```

/// html | div.result
*I'm italic. **I'm bold and italic.** I'm also just italic.*
///


BetterEm will ensure smart mode doesn't terminate in scenarios where there are a large amount of consecutive tokens
inside.

```text title="Consecutive Token"
___A lot of underscores____________is okay___
```

/// html | div.result
___A lot of underscores____________is okay___
///

BetterEm will also ensure that smart mode breaks properly when an inner like token signifies an end.

```text title="Smart Break"
__This will all be bold __because of the placement of the center underscores.__

__This will all be bold __ because of the placement of the center underscores.__

__This will NOT all be bold__ because of the placement of the center underscores.__

__This will all be bold_ because of the token is less than that of the surrounding.__
```

/// html | div.result
__This will all be bold __because of the placement of the center underscores.__

__This will all be bold __ because of the placement of the center underscores.__

__This will NOT all be bold__ because of the placement of the center underscores.__

__This will all be bold_ because the token count is less than that of the surrounding.__
///

BetterEm will allow non-smart emphasis to contain "floating" like tokens.

```text title="Floating Token"
*All will * be italic*

*All will *be italic*

*All will not* be italic*

*All will not ** be italic*

**All will * be bold**

**All will *be bold**

**All will not*** be bold**

**All will not *** be bold**
```

/// html | div.result
*All will * be italic*

*All will *be italic*

*All will not* be italic*

*All will ** be italic*

**All will * be bold**

**All will *be bold**

**All will not*** be bold**

**All will not ***be bold**
///
