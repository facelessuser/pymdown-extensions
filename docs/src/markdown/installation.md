# Installation

## Requirements

In order for PyMdown Extensions to work, there are a couple of prerequisites.

Name                                      | Required | Details
----------------------------------------- | -------- | -------
[Python Markdown 2.6.0+][python-markdown] | Yes      |Python Markdown must be installed as it is the Markdown parser that is being used.
[Pygments 2.0.1+ (optional)][pygments]    | No       | If Pygments Syntax highlighting is desired, Pygments must be installed.  This can be omitted, and code blocks (if using the CodeHilite extension) will be formatter for use with JavaScript code highlighters.

## Installation

Installation is easy with pip:

```bash
pip install pymdown-extensions
```

If you want to manually install it, run `#!bash python setup.py build` and `#!bash python setup.py install`.  You should be able to access the extensions in Python Markdown under the namespace `pymdownx.<extension>`.

If you would like to modify the code, you can install it via: `#!bash pip install --editable .`.  This method will allow you to instantly see your changes without reinstalling.  If you want to do this in a virtual machine, you can.
