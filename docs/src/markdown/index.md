# PyMdown Extensions

## Usage

PyMdown Extensions is a collection of extensions for Python Markdown.  Keep in mind, the PyMdown extensions were designed to work with the default extensions, so your mileage may vary in regards to compatibility when paired with other 3rd party extensions.

All extensions are found under `pymdownx`.  Assuming we wanted to specify the use of the MagicLink extension, we would include it in Python Markdown like so:

```pycon3
>>> import markdown
>>> text = "A link https://google.com"
>>> html = markdown.markdown(text, ['pymdownx.magiclink'])
'<p>A link <a href="https://google.com">https://google.com</a></p>'
```

Check out documentation on each extension to learn more about how to configure and use each one.
